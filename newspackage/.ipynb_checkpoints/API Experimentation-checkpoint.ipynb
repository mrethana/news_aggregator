It is a specific state of the body, which is characterized by an elevated level of ketones in the blood which occurs due to the conversion of fats into fatty acid and ketones. This occurs when the body gets only very small amounts of carbohydrates over a certain period of time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you start with this type of diet, your body goes through several changes. After 24 to 48 hours since the beginning of this diet, the body starts to use ketones in order to use the energy stored in fat cells more efficiently.

If you are looking to break out of this weight loss rut once and for all, then &lt;i&gt;Ketogenic Diet for Beginners: Living the Keto Lifestyle , Keto Instant Pot, and Keto Slow Cooker&lt;/i&gt; is the audiobook you have been waiting for.&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike those other diets, the ketogenic diet focuses not on how much you eat, but the types of food you eat, cutting o...</td>\n",
