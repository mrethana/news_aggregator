Really hope you enjoy it!\\n\\nMORE INFO: Coconut water consists of naturally occurring sugars, sometimes added sugar, as well as small amounts of naturally occurring vitamin C and potassium. However, there’s double the amount of vitamin C though in a glass of orange juice! In my opinion, coconut water is NOT as good as water for day to day hydration, as water is sugar free as well as being much cheaper, but you could argue that if you’re having a no added sugar variety of coconut water then it’s much better than drinking a full sugar fizzy drink. Ideally we should be having at least 8 x 200ml glasses of fluid a day to stay hydrated.\\n\\nNic x\\n\\n——————————————\\n\\nThank you so much for ...</td>\n",

I’m not ‘vegetarian’ but it just so happened that I didn’t eat any meat that day.. I would say I eat more of a ‘flexitarian’ diet (although I HATE labels!) whereby I eat mainly ‘vegetarian’ but still include small amounts of meat, poultry &amp; fish (especially salmon!) on a weekly basis. Buying less meat &amp; more plant based protein actually saves money &amp; it’s a great way of getting in more FIBRE too!! What do YOU eat in a day? Is it similar or different?!

       "15  Hey guys! So in case you missed me talking all about coconut water on Rip off Britian here is the clip! Really hope you enjoy it!\\n\\nMORE INFO: Coconut water consists of naturally occurring sugars, sometimes added sugar, as well as small amounts of naturally occurring vitamin C and potassium. However, there’s double the amount of vitamin C though in a glass of orange juice! In my opinion, coconut water is NOT as good as water for day to day hydration, as water is sugar free as well as being much cheaper, but you could argue that if you’re having a no added sugar variety of coconut water then it’s much better than drinking a full sugar fizzy drink. Ideally we should be having at least 8 x 200ml glasses of fluid a day to stay hydrated.\\n\\nNic x\\n\\n——————————————\\n\\nThank you so much for ...   \n",

       "20  So guys, I’ve filmed a bit of a different video for me but I really hope you like it. I filmed everything that I ate in a day, PLUS what I bought in my online food shop. Remember my eating philosophy.. I follow (loosely!) the 80/20 rule where I try to eat mainly whole-foods but still allow more indulgent foods as I want them. I’m not ‘vegetarian’ but it just so happened that I didn’t eat any meat that day.. I would say I eat more of a ‘flexitarian’ diet (although I HATE labels!) whereby I eat mainly ‘vegetarian’ but still include small amounts of meat, poultry & fish (especially salmon!) on a weekly basis. Buying less meat & more plant based protein actually saves money & it’s a great way of getting in more FIBRE too!! What do YOU eat in a day? Is it similar or different?! I would love...   \n",
