The Paleo movement is one of today's hottest diet and healthy-eating approaches. Its appeal comes from the fact that it is a sustainable alternative to more restrictive diets that often lead to burnout and failed weight loss efforts.

It sounds like the complete opposite of everything we’ve been told about weight loss for the past few decades, but strong research backs up the science behind the ketogenic diet. As you replace most of the carbohydrates in your diet with fat, major physiological changes occur that make it easier for many people to lose weight. In most cases, they also see lower blood pressure and cholesterol and other health benefits!<br /><br />This book is a complete guide to beginning the ketogenic diet.<br /><br />It will teach you about:<br /><b>Ketogenic Diet</b><b>Who Should Follow the Ketogenic Diet</b><b>Ketosis</b><b>What to Eat</b><b>How to Begin the Ketogenic Diet</b><b>Possible Side Effects</b><b>5-week Meal Plan</b><b>Over 90 Delicious and Healthy Recipes</b><br />Some of the recipes include:<br />Chocolate Hazelnut SmoothieGolden Coconut SmoothieAnti-Inflammatory Spice SmoothieCoconut Almond PorridgePeanut SauceScrambled Eggs with Mushrooms and BrieSalmon Salad with Rich Balsamic DressingCreamy Spinach SoupSteak Salad with Blue Cheese DressingChilled Summer Soup with Asiago CroutonsTurkey Burgers with SageChicken Stir Fry with Peanut SauceBaked Arctic Char with Sour Cream and ChivesBeef ChiliKeto Irish Beef StewSalami Cheese Roll-upsKale Chips<br />Get your copy and start your Ketogenic Diet Journey today!<br /><br /><b>See You on the Effective Side!</b><br /><br /><b>-Chef Effect</b>',\n",

       "   'description': 'For those who are brand-new to keto and those who are getting back on track after falling off the wagon, the first 30 days on a ketogenic diet can be challenging. As the body adapts to burning fat (ketones) rather than sugar for fuel, cravings can arise, and some people find that they just don\\'t feel so great. Many fall victim to the temptation to give up before they can truly experience the benefits of being keto-adapted. \"The 30-Day Ketogenic Cleanse\" isn\\'t like most juice or other cleanses where you starve throughout the entire process. Keto expert Maria Emmerich offers tasty whole-food recipes--all dairy-free and nut-free--that are filling and satisfying and keep cravings at bay. Plus, she offers helpful tips and tricks for making it through the adjustment period.<br /><br />\\n\"The 30-Day Ketogenic Cleanse\" is a guidebook for healing the body from the inside out. Most people attempting a keto diet do it completely wrong. Maria Emmerich, on the other hand, bases this cleanse on a true, well-formulated ketogenic diet, helping readers reset their metabolism, regain health, lose weight, and tap into increased energy levels. This book includes:<br /><br />\\n--A detailed explanation of how sugar causes inflammation and leads to disease<br />\\n--30-day meal plans to kick-start ketosis, with corresponding shopping lists<br />\\n--30-day Whole30-compliant meal plans, with corresponding shopping lists<br />\\n--A wide variety of amazing recipes, with suggestions for combining those recipes into delicious and satisfying ketogenic meals<br />\\n--Easily accessible lists of approved keto foods and foods that hold people back from ketosis<br />\\n--Tips on how to eat to balance hormones, sleep better, feel better, and lose weight while following a ketogenic diet<br />\\n--Guidance for maintaining ketosis after a successful 30-day cleanse<br />\\n--Recommendations for supplements to help heal from poor eating habits<br />\\n--A bonus slow cooker chapter to help make life easier!',\n",

The unique features of Ketosis are; the diet is low in carbohydrates, supplies adequate protein to the body, and is high in fat.<br /><br />This distinctive combination alters the way energy is used by the body. The Fat is transformed in the liver to ketone bodies and fatty acids. In addition, a Ketogenic diet benefits the body as the cut back lowers glucose levels and improves insulin resistance.<br /><br />If you have been struggling with weight loss or health issues for a while then the ketogenic diet could work for you.

Several other benefits are also found with the ketogenic diet. One of which is for weight loss. Burn fat by eating more fat is what they say. That is the running version of weight loss programs that incorporate a ketogenic diet.

Do you want to shed the extra flab from your body and sport a lean physique? Do you want to feel energized all through the day even when you are dieting? Have you been thinking of trying healthy and innovative keto recipes? Do you want to spend less time in the kitchen but get some colorful and tasty keto meals on your plate? If your answer to any of the questions mentioned above is a yes, you have come to the right place.<br /><br />The most common and popular reason people follow the ketogenic diet is to lose weight. When you are in the process of losing weight by following a keto diet, your initial weight loss comes from the loss of water. This is because you cut down the carbohydrates in your diet. Ultimately, this forces the body to use all the carbs (glucose) stored in the liver, which holds the water content. Since the body is fed with healthy fats and whole foods, it results in further weight loss as it burns these dietary fats for energy. Slowly the stored fats are also broken down and fueled into energy.<br /><br />When you cut the carbs, you also cut the sugar, which means your body gets steady energy making you feel energetic all through the day. No more sugar crash or sugar rush!<br /><br />Through the course of the book, we intend to discuss some easy to cook recipes for a healthy keto diet plan. Here is a quick snapshot of some of the delicious Ketogenic crockpot recipes:<br />Cauliflower Hash Browns CasseroleCrispy Pork Carnitas in Slow CookerFire Roasted Shrimp TacosChicken Tikka masalaMocha Pudding Cake&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;And much more<br />All the recipes are cooked in a crockpot and are extremely nutritious and delicious. So what are you waiting for?&#xa0;<br /><br /><b>What Are You Waiting For?</b><br /><br />One-Click for a Healthier, Happier You!<br /><br /><b>Satisfaction is&#xa0;<i>100% GUARANTEED!</i></b>',\n",
