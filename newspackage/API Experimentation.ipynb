So why go through a series of fancy steps trying to get into ketosis on a normal diet, or a typical low-carb diet, when you can go straight to ketosis by adopting a ketogenic diet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ketogenic diet described within this audiobook adopts the l...</td>\n",

Soon these brave young men were hurtling themselves and their unproven planes across the Channel and into the teeth of enemy firepower, raining down bombs on the German military machine, and going up against Hitler's best fliers in the sky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the dramatic oral history of the Army Air Corps and the newly created Eighth Air Force stationed in Britain, an army of hard-fi...</td>\n",

After all, what could possibly be art-worthy about an early Mario score? Or any early game sound for that matter? <br /><br />In search of answers to these questions, Andrew Schartmann takes us on a journey from the primitive \"pongs\" of arcade machines to the complex musical fabrics woven by composers of the NES era.

       "   'description': \"Leading health blogger Jimmy Moore and researcher and internist Dr. Eric C. Westman join forces again to explain the powerful therapeutic effects of a ketogenic diet—one that combines a customized carbohydrate restriction, moderation of protein intake, and real food-based fats—which is emerging in the scientific literature as a means for improving a wide range of diseases, from Type 2 diabetes to Alzheimer's and more. Simply eating a low-carb diet alone isn't enough, and Moore and Westman tell you why. Have you looked at a low-carb diet simply as a means to lose weight? What if you learned that combining a low-carb nutritional approach with a high fat intake produces a powerful therapeutic effect on a wide variety of health conditions that most people think requires medication to control? That’s what Keto Clarity is all about. Jimmy Moore, a leading low-carb diet blogger and podcaster, has reunited with his Cholesterol Clarity co-author Dr. Eric C. Westman, a practicing internist and low-carb diet researcher, to bring you the crystal-clear information you need to understand what a ketogenic diet is and why it may be the missing element in your pursuit of optimal health. This book includes exclusive interviews from twenty of the world's foremost authorities from various fields bringing their depth of expertise and experience using this nutritional approach. Moore and Westman explain why ketosis is normal and how this nutritional approach is being used therapeutically by many medical professionals. You will find a step-by-step guide to help you produce more ketones and track your progress, real life success stories, and more. The solid evidence for nutritional ketosis in dealing with many of the chronic health problems of our day is presented, including but not limited to: epilepsy, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome.\"},\n",

This is the lifestyle change that empowers your body and mind to achieve the state of health you've been searching for. <br /><br /><b>The Big Fat-Burning Science</b> <br /><br />All forms of carbohydrates - fruits, vegetables, grains, and starches - are broken down into glucose by your body, increasing your blood sugar. Your body considers raised blood sugar toxic, so it releases insulin (a storage hormone) to push the glucose into your cells. Once this occurs your blood sugar decreases, making you hungry again. <br /><br />This vicious cycle of blood sugar highs and lows is why you experience endless hunger and cravings. <br /><br />The release of insulin halts your body's ability to release fat and toxins. If you're eating carbohydrate-based foods every two to three hours, your body is never fully able to exercise its ability to rid itself of excess. And if more carbohydrates are consumed than what your body needs, they will be converted into triglycerides and stored in your blood, leading to weight gain and unbalanced cholesterol.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Mark Sisson - author of the mega-best-seller <i>The Primal Blueprint</i> - unveils his groundbreaking ketogenic diet plan that resets your metabolism in 21 days so you can burn fat forever.<br /><br />Mounting scientific research is confirming that eating a ketogenic diet could represent one of the greatest nutritional breakthroughs of our time - and that it might be the healthiest and most effective weight loss strategy ever. Going \"keto\" by eating high fat, low-to-moderate protein, and low-carb foods enables you to break free from the disastrous effects of carbohydrate dependency by resetting your metabolism and promoting metabolic flexibility - where your body learns to burns fat instead of sugar for energy, even when you go off plan.<br /><br />Unlike many other ketogenic programs that require challenging restrictions and deprivation or offer misinformation, Mark Sisson, best-selling author of <i>The Primal Blueprint</i> and publisher of the number-one paleo blog MarksDailyApple.com, presents a unique two-step, scientifically validated approach for going keto the right way. He first reveals the real secret to rapid and sustained weight loss, which is in becoming \"fat-adapted\" before entering full nutritional ketosis. This process allows your body to learn to burn fat more efficiently, resulting in increased and sustained weight loss over the long term. It takes as little as 21 days to reprogram your metabolism to burn fat for fuel, by ditching processed grains, sugars, and refined vegetable oils in favor of nutrient-dense, high fat, primal/paleo foods - and you\\'ll see immediate results. Next, you\\'ll fine-tune with intermittent fasting and then foray into full ketogenic eating for a further weight loss boost and improved health.<br /><br />With <i>The Keto Reset Diet</i>, you can eat to total satisfaction by enjoying rich, high-satiety foods and even weather occasional slip-ups. You\\'ll use keto as a lifelong tool to stay trim, healthy, energetic, and free from the disastrous health conditions caused by the typical American diet. With step-by-step guidance, daily meal plans, and a recipe section with over 100 delicious keto-friendly recipes, this is the definitive guide to help the keto-beginner or the experienced health enthusiast understand the what, why, and how to succeed with ketogenic eating.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"The ketogenic diet is one of the simplest menus around. To start, you just need to do one thing: eat high fat, moderate protein, and low carb. Eating a high-fat diet leads your body into a state called ketosis. In ketosis, your body will burn fat for energy, leading to incredible weight loss benefits.<br /><br />Everyone has a different body, so you’ll need to pay attention to the signs and listen to your body to determine when you’re in ketosis.

       "   'description': \"Ketogenic Diet series book number one.<br /><br />Low-carb diets are one of the most popular types of diet around, and for good reason. Many people report weight loss, weight management, and health improvements from going low carb. But what about the people who succeed on other diets? And why do some people fail to meet their goals on a low-carb diet? One simple answer: ketosis.<br /><br />Ketosis is essential to losing weight. It is the process by which we get energy from fat. And if you're not in ketosis, you're not losing body fat. So why go through a series of fancy steps trying to get into ketosis on a normal diet, or a typical low-carb diet, when you can go straight to ketosis by adopting a ketogenic diet?<br /><br />The ketogenic diet described within this audiobook adopts the latest in nutrition research, the best foods for our bodies, and eliminates all the unnecessary messing around. No more counting points or calories in detail. No more fighting carb cravings every day. And no more avoiding healthy vegetables because of a fad diet. This time you can focus on healthy whole foods, a low-carb diet, and a no cravings solution, for now, or forever!<br /><br />Start living the keto lifestyle today!\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'A ketogenic diet isn\\'t something new that has been recently formulated; people have been on a ketogenic diet for virtually three million years in which our brains were nurtured and evolved. Now the human brain is not only shrinking, but brain atrophy is the norm as we age and get plagued with diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer\\'s disease and Parkinson\\'s disease. <br /><br />People mistakenly think that they need to eat less and exercise more to create a calorie deficit in order to lose weight. This is not how diet and exercise helps with weight loss. A well-formulated keto-adapted diet along with proper exercise builds muscle and muscle builds mitochondria. It is in the mitochondria where fat is oxidized so you can keep your cells and liver insulin sensitized. Weight loss and health is about healthy mitochondria and about controlling hormones and specifically insulin. <br /><br />This is not a diet, it is a lifestyle. By eating this way, you will begin to heal your cells and will keep evolving your body into the happy and healthy person you want to be. This book is filled with the most impeccable nutrition information to fuel your cells. Maria\\'s passion goes beyond explaining the \"why\", she is a master in the kitchen and loves food. Her keto-adapted recipes at the end of the book tie all the nutrition together so you can become <i>Keto-Adapted</i> faster than ever.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Are you eating enough fat? Yes, fat. Despite what generations of health science has beaten into us over the last 50 years or so, humans thrive on high-fat, low-carb diets. Millions of people around the world have discovered that a ketogenic lifestyle is the key to weight loss, disease prevention and intervention, and a more vibrant life, along with a slimmer waistline, elimination of cravings, and endless energy.<br /><br />Gone are the days when counting calories or points was seen as the path to better health. Craig and Maria Emmerich have teamed up to create an audiobook that digs deep into the science of ketogenic dieting, explaining how it can cure or control dozens of diseases and how it is fueling a new breed of athlete. All this is done in an easy-to-understand way that makes the complicated science much more approachable.<br /><br /><i>Keto </i>is the definitive guide to the ketogenic lifestyle. You will learn how you can beat cancer, obesity, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, ADHD, anxiety, and depression into submission by making some simple yet impactful changes to your diet.&#xa0;You'll learn:<br />\\n\\nHow cholesterol and diabetes medications could very well be making you sicker rather than healthier.&#xa0;\\nHow generations of bad advice and advice designed to sell sugar, not health, has killed millions of people who blindly trusted the medical establishment and, worse still, the government to tell them the truth.&#xa0;\\nHow the overconsumption of carbohydrates is bad for your health and could be at the root of what ails you.&#xa0;\\nHow changing your inputs and the foods you eat can change your outputs, meaning your quality of life.\\nHow reductions in fat consumption have led to a tripling of diabetes patients, sharp increases in the number of cancer patients, increases in ADHD, and a meteoric rise in heart disease rates. If we are to assume that eliminating fat from our diets is the key to good health, why then are more and more people who’ve followed this advice dying from food-related diseases?\\nHow inflammation is at the root of many diseases, and how modern diets that are rife with sugar, carbs, and omega-6 oils are sending us to early graves.\\nHow hormones control mood swings, sex drive, blood sugar levels, muscle tone, fat-burning ability, metabolism, the immune system, and much more - and how adopting a ketogenic lifestyle will change your waistline and your life!\\nHow you can build muscle and perform your best on a low-carb, high-fat diet.

       "   'description': \"This book includes:<br /> \\n \\n <i>Keto Diet for Beginners</i> \\n <i>Keto Recipes</i> \\n <i>Keto Diet</i> \\n \\n<br />The Ketogenic diet is a very successful weight-loss program. It utilizes high fat and low carbohydrate ingredients in order to burn fat instead of glucose. Many people are familiar with the Atkins diet, but the Keto plan restricts carbs even more.<br /><br />Why you should listen to this book:<br /><br />Advantages of The Ketogenic Diet - weight loss is a huge benefit of ketogenic diets due to lowered insulin levels and the body's ability to burn stored fat. I've personally found that the classic ketogenic diet is quite possibly the best diet for weight loss, especially considering how quickly it usually works.<br /><br />Following a Ketogenic diet may also prevent and even kill cancer cells.<br /><br />Additionally, ketogenic diets have been used to treat and even help reverse cognitive impairments, including Alzheimers symptoms.<br /><br />The ketogenic diet is a diet based on a process called ketosis. It is a specific state of the body, which is characterized by an elevated level of ketones in the blood which occurs due to the conversion of fats into fatty acid and ketones. This occurs when the body gets only very small amounts of carbohydrates over a certain period of time.<br /><br />When you start with this type of diet, your body goes through several changes. After 24 to 48 hours since the beginning of this diet, the body starts to use ketones in order to use the energy stored in fat cells more efficiently. In other words, a primary source of energy becomes fat, instead of carbohydrates.<br /><br />Because of that, during ketosis it is not a problem to eat food with bigger amount of fact, than would otherwise seem reasonable.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'A ketogenic diet isn\\'t something new that has been recently formulated; people have been on a ketogenic diet for virtually three million years in which our brains were nurtured and evolved. Now the human brain is not only shrinking, but brain atrophy is the norm as we age and get plagued with diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer\\'s disease and Parkinson\\'s disease. <br /><br />People mistakenly think that they need to eat less and exercise more to create a calorie deficit in order to lose weight. This is not how diet and exercise helps with weight loss. A well-formulated keto-adapted diet along with proper exercise builds muscle and muscle builds mitochondria. It is in the mitochondria where fat is oxidized so you can keep your cells and liver insulin sensitized. Weight loss and health is about healthy mitochondria and about controlling hormones and specifically insulin. <br /><br />This is not a diet, it is a lifestyle. By eating this way, you will begin to heal your cells and will keep evolving your body into the happy and healthy person you want to be. This book is filled with the most impeccable nutrition information to fuel your cells. Maria\\'s passion goes beyond explaining the \"why\", she is a master in the kitchen and loves food. Her keto-adapted recipes at the end of the book tie all the nutrition together so you can become <i>Keto-Adapted</i> faster than ever.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Is a ketogenic diet for vegetarians reasonably possible?<br /><br />To be perfectly honest with you, keto vegetarian is the most hardcore dieting imaginable. It can be mentally and emotionally exhausting to feel deprived of all the juicy, processed foods, so this diet definitely isn’t for beginners. Another challenge is adapting this kind of diet to your lifestyle while still keeping its core tenets intact. As soon as you start a keto vegetarian diet, you’ll realize why carbs are so popular: they’re easy to make, handle transport well, and taste great. So, unless you have your logistics down to a science, you’ll find it very difficult to maintain a keto vegetarian diet, but you should try it, nonetheless, and keep trying until you make it.<br /><br />Eating fewer carbs and more fat lowers insulin, which is responsible for fat storage. By maintaining low insulin in your blood, the body slowly starts to spend its fat reserves and enters a state known as “ketosis”. There are several stages of ketosis, but what you want to aim for is called “optimal ketosis”.&#xa0;<br /><br />To measure your ketosis, you need a specialized gadget for measuring ketone blood levels. Before breakfast, prick your finger and the gadget will tell you the level of ketones in your blood. Any value between 1.5 and 3 mmol/Lis optimal ketosis and greatly accelerates weight loss.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Did you know you can lose weight by eating fats? Have you already followed countless diets without actually seeing any results? <br /> &#xa0;<br /><br />The ketogenic diet, or keto diet, is a solid dieting program created back in 1924 by Dr. Russel Wilder and supported by many scientific studies. The keto diet is not another diet that promises you everything and delivers you little or nothing! The keto diet is based on the principle that your body usually gets energy from the carbs you eat and stores all the excess fats. Think love handles or belly fat. Most diets&#xa0;tell you to stop eating fats to lose weight, but there's a better way to do it. In fact, if you start eating foods low in carb and high in fat, your body will use the fats instead of the carbohydrates to produce energy without actually storing them.<br /> &#xa0;<br /><br />Just by eating the right foods in the keto diet, your body will naturally burn fats for you, and the best part is ketogenic foods actually taste really good. <br /> &#xa0;<br /><br />Following this diet is easy when you have the right help. You'll learn everything you need to know about the keto diet to help you lose weight fast and feel better without being too tricky or complicated. You'll learn exactly what to eat, what to avoid, what recipes to cook, and what to store in your pantry to follow the keto diet correctly and start improving your health right now.<br /> &#xa0;<br /><br />In this book you'll learn:<br /> \\n \\n What ketogenic diet is and how it works<br /> &#xa0; \\n A complete 14-day keto meal plan to successfully go keto<br /> &#xa0; \\n More than 20 delicious keto recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner<br /> &#xa0; \\n A list of keto-friendly foods to store in your pantry<br /> &#xa0; \\n The complete keto shopping list to fill your cart with healthy foods<br /> &#xa0; \\n How to know if you shouldn't follow this diet<br /> &#xa0; \\n How to stay on the keto diet through the holidays<br /> &#xa0; \\n And much more! \\n \\n<br />Start improving&#xa0;your health today! <br /> &#xa0;\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'There are many ways to diet using various kinds of philosophies. One proven method is to do low carbohydrate dieting. One form of low-carb dieting is called the ketogenic diet. <br /><br />This diet makes the body go into a state called ketosis. This state helps the body make sure it burns fat cells as carbohydrates are restricted so the body has to then turn to fat for its main source of energy. To ensure we can get to a ketogenic state, foods high in digestible carbohydrates should be replaced with foods low in carbohydrates. <br /><br />As we limit the amount of carbohydrates, and thus the calories from them, we need to ensure we get enough calories from other sources, mainly protein and fat. One well-known diet, Atkins, relies on this methodology during its \"induction phase.\" This induction phase makes the participant eat a very low amount of carbohydrates whilst eating a high amount of protein and a moderate level of fat. <br /><br />An excellent low carb ketogenic diet is called this cyclical ketogenic diet. The diet breaks down the amount of protein, carbs, and fat into what is called macros. These macros help you distribute how much of each source of calories, so you eat the right amount for each meal. The best breakdown of calories from protein, carbs, and fat is a 65% fat, 30% protein, 5% carbohydrates ratio. The reason this diet is called a cyclical ketogenic diet is because we spend five days of the week doing a low carb phase and then the next two days is a high-carb, or carb-up, phase.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'The ketogenic diet is a diet based on a process called ketosis. It is a specific state of the body, which is characterized by an elevated level of ketones in the blood which occurs due to the conversion of fats into fatty acid and ketones. This occurs when the body gets only very small amounts of carbohydrates over a certain period of time. <br /><br />When you start with this type of diet, your body goes through several changes. After 24 to 48 hours since the beginning of this diet, the body starts to use ketones in order to use the energy stored in fat cells more efficiently. In other words, a primary source of energy becomes fat, instead of carbohydrates. <br /><br />Because of that, during ketosis it is not a problem to eat food with bigger amount of fact, than would otherwise seem reasonable <br /><br />This way the body is rapidly losing weight, specifically in fat. In addition, the loss of muscle tissue is minimal since the vast majority of food consumed during ketosis also contains relatively large amounts of proteins that are good for your muscles. <br /><br />If you are interested in finding out more about this diet, listen to this interesting and informative book to find out more about the ketogenic diet.'},\n",
