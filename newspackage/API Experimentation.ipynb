      "{'title': 'Episode #7: MTHFR Mutation and Supplements to Help You', 'description': \"Are you a carrier of MTHFR? &nbsp;Don't know? &nbsp;Well, Frank discusses his situation with MTHFR and what supplements he uses to combat his condition.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\nHere are the notes from today's show:\\n\\n\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone and welcome to unconventional wellness radio is a powerful and inspiring podcast set to revolutionize and disrupt healthcare. It's trying to put you in the driver's seat and be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted. So anyway, I wanted to come on here guys and I want to start really unpackaging the Mthfr mutation and uh, and what we've been doing to a supplemental. Now, Mthfr stands for methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase. Say that five times fast. Um, it's actually the key gene responsible for coding for the enzyme that is responsible for methylating certain things in your body predominantly, you know, full laid, b, 12 things of that nature. But long story short is with a gene discrepancy, there are two that are not identified on two different. Okay, let's, let's, let's back the train up and not get super scientific with it, but in order to understand what Mthfr is and when and why are we starting to throw some understanding to it, let's start trying to understand how genes work.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay? So we all know that we have a genetic profile, right? We have something that makes us up. There's something called the Geno type and a phenotype. The genotype is actually your genetic information, whereas your phenotype is what is expressed. Okay, so for example, let's just say that my genes code for me to have around here. Okay, so the phenotype is that I have brown hair. The geno type could be whatever. Geneticists have determined a could be the gene specifically that codes for brown hair. So like let's just say that that's something that we'll refer to as either a big B, meaning that it's dominant. That's another thing that we'll talk about here in a second or a little bit, which means that it's recessive. Well, in my family, most of us have brown hair. The reason being is because it's very dominant in folks of Mediterranean heritage, like myself, you know, Italians and Greeks and anybody around that entire area of Europe predominantly have black hair, black or brown hair.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, of course there are exceptions to the rule, but here's the deal. The dominant been is not being expressed. That's actually that little bee that's being expressed and that could like code for something like not brown hair. So therefore it could be red headed, it could be Brunette or excuse me, an opportunity that is black hair, but it could be blonde. Okay. So why I'm saying that is because we are finding out that our genetic makeup is of which most people may have a mutation, meaning that they don't have the excepted type of Jean at that particular space in their genetic profile and therefore they now have a problem with creating the appropriate levels of the Mthfr, which is the enzyme, right? Well the MTHFR which, which codes for an enzyme. So there's a spot that you can google. I'm there too and I know mine very well.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine is actually at what they call the c six slash 77. Illegal and illegal is the actual physical location of the gene and it's amazing guys that we live in a world now where we actually know what people's genetic profiles or I mean for the first time in human history of the human genome has been mapped. Like we know on each one of our chromosomes all 23 chromosomes. We know exactly what Leo is for what. And we know like what codes for what I mean, it's unreal. They've been doing this since the 19 forties and just in the last 10 years or so, 10 to 15 years, we've actually mapped out the entire human genome. So unbelievably impressive. Which brings me to the understanding of now we are starting to understand genetics now. We're just starting to get on the tip of something called epigenetics and epigenetics is showing a little bit more promise and it's understanding and ability to influence human health because we are now taking consideration diet nutrition or diet and nutrition, environmental factors, things like talks and stuff like that into consideration and how our genes also get expressed.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so now it's like really, really we're getting into the weeds, if you will, about like how well we can understand our genes. One of the most, uh, famous epigenetic studies that I know of is involving two rats and the rats have the same genetic profile. And what they did was they had one rep was a going to be exposed to nothing but healthy living conditions and environments only given a certain specific diet of nutritious food. And given the ability to exercise and all that sort of thing, the other diet, or excuse me, the other rat had all of the, you know, a calorie filled and, and just it did not have it barely exercise. And what they were finding out is that these two rats with the same exact genetic profile, the one that they actually gave all of the healthy things to was in fact more healthy.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the one that was actually just given whatever that one actually in fact ended up being overweight, you know, had a bunch of different little health conditions and stuff like that. So pretty impressive that we have that going on. And we know now that even with somebody with the same genetic profile, all things being equal except for their environmental conditions, we may have expression of disease. I say again, as I said before, and you'll hear me say often is that eighty cents right now actually have a preventable disease. What that means is that all of the diseases that we see now, all of the chronic illnesses that you see in America are treatable. There actually not even supposed to happen in the first place because if we are taking care of ourselves through the appropriate lifestyle choices that we need to be, we in fact would not have these chronic illnesses because we would actually be giving our bodies the way of being able to cope with these things, making those correct lifestyle choices and be completely fine.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. So saying all that, we now know that there is a condition called Mthfr. We just know it as that, but it's not really necessarily a anything more than a mutation. And you get have it on two different spots and you can also have, like I said, I don't want to get super into science, but you can either have a, a calm palm, homozygous, a compound heterozygous or just a homozygous. My myself, I'm actually homozygous meaning that one base pair right has been changed and I now have a mutation. Alright, now it's not like the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles, like the 19 nineties where I'm going to turn green and, you know, ended up getting a turtle shell or something like that. But anyway, for all your millennials, um, hopefully you watched it when you were a kid because it's an amazing show. Um, but anyway, so I now have a mutation and it just so happens that the one that came from my mother and the one that came from my father, I just so happen to get a pairing of two, um, two recessive if you will, a mutated versions and there's certain to find out.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers are starting to find out that up to 50 percent of the population may be infected or affected by a mutation in their mthfr gene. And so I say all that because it's the 19 fifties. We've been told that folic acid is unbelievably important to our health. And I'm not going to make this a debate on folic acid, but what I will tell you is this full of gas that is crucial in terms of needing full late. Right? So pregnant women, the very first thing that they're told by a practitioner to include myself, what I used to tell them was make sure that you're taking a supplement that's very adequate and full late. The reason being is because that that deliberately goes into the development of the spinal canal and the rest of you know, the beginnings of the nervous system with a with an unborn baby and so super crucial.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should be taking folic acid. We've known that now since the 19 fifties. The fact of the matter is is that the government did have a very good idea and they said, well, why don't we go ahead and start making it a nutritional requirement for people who make food in America that they need to add full light to their products while they started creating something called folic acid because it was easier to synthesize in the lab than it was for us to go out and resource it and somehow into north cereals and pastas and all those other carbohydrate type of things that we now have that are ready to go in their boxes. Well, there's a problem with folic acid with people who have mthfr. We have a difficulty with the very first step of taking that synthetically made folic acid and actually turning it into a bioavailable version of Foley, and so therefore we really want to watch the amount of folic acid that we consume.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself, I've probably consumed barely any folic acid anymore and the reason being is because I specifically watch out for it because I want to make sure that I am methylating the way that I should be. Now let's talk about methylation for a little bit. Methylation is something like a light switch in the human body. You either are going to turn it on or turn it off. We call that up and downregulation is the fancy medical way of saying that we want to upregulate certain genes at a, at a specific time. Maybe they need to react to something that is going on inside of the body that we're of course totally unaware of. There are literally millions upon millions of things going on inside of our body that we have no idea and I'm super grateful for that because our bodies are programmed to take care of that on their own.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then we also may have to downregulate things too. It becomes difficult when we have an overregulation of certain pathways, but then under regulation of those pathways that are supposed to be shutting them off, that's where we run into a lot of health concerns and health problems. And so, um, first thing that I decided, you know, once I, let me, let me caveat this entire thing by saying, getting genetic research testing or getting your DNA tested is something that I'm going to leave completely up to you. I don't represent anybody, you know, I'm not going to talk about any of the companies that are out there. You can get them now like over the counter, like you don't even have to actually like mail order them anymore, but it's entirely up to you. If you want to go ahead and spend the money to do it, that's your prerogative.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. Remember that now that you have that knowledge, that raw data, if you will, and I have to have a process. So you've got to go to a different company and they'll actually process it forteo and then you'll find out really what your genes are all about. What are your genes actually telling, um, in terms of your health status? Well, the problem is with that is now you know, so usually ignorance is bliss. I follow a gentleman by the name of Dr Ben Lynch, who was actually a very astute in terms of the epigenetics. He's been studying now for a long time and he actually wrote a book called dirty jeans and I really, I really appreciate this book and I really like it. And what it does is it actually talks about how to clean up your genes because it just talks about Mthfr but also talks about six other, a more common genetic mutations that might happen that lead, do certain types of conditions.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well anyway, I, I actually love it because he too also says like, don't worry about going out and go get genetic testing. You can clean up your genes without necessarily going overboard and getting all of this testing done and, and all those sorts of things. You base it off of symptoms. Okay. And so anyway, I say all that because I don't want you to go out there and spend tons of money. All right? I don't want anybody to spend tons of money. I want you to, to be smart about it. Make informed choices that you feel are going to be beneficial for you. All right? So everybody's journey is going to be slightly different. I'm just going to blanket this thing and tell you about everything that I'm doing and then you just go ahead and piece things together and determine if you want to do it as well.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so I, I, like I said, the first thing I did was I watched out for the amount of follow casts that I was getting in my diet. Okay. So that means that I had to start off with, I know that I should be on a multivitamin and so therefore, what multivitamin should I take? Okay. There are that. Well, we'll get into the supplements here shortly, but folks, I'm not gonna. I'm not necessarily going to talk about any particular types of supplements nor studied like who's good, who's bad. I would just simply say that you want to make sure that you get the ones that are well thought out by companies. You don't want to. You don't want to break the bank because some supplements can be awfully expensive, but you also don't want to get the supplements that are just very inexpensive and just they're there.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it, to me, the store really mattered, you know? And so I, I ended up going to a certain couple of stores that I knew that were health food stores that I knew I was going to get whole food supplements, know these companies that actually determined and think these things out and actually come up with really good supplements. There might be bitter supplements out there guys, and I guarantee you I'm going to see them in the comments about like, oh, well, I, I think that's great, but I take this instead and that's, let's do it. Right? So like, if you have a supplement that you just love that you want to, you want to scream screaming from the mountain tops, let us know because we're all in this together. This is all a community effort here and by all means, nobody's perfect and you know, I might be taking something that you've got a better version of it out there.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I'm actually interested in as well, like this is like something that I'm doing now with the best of the information that I have right now, but of course I'm here for improvement as well. And so I really want to make sure that we, you know, lose our sense of attitude about like, mine's the best. This is the best, this is the worst. Let us know. That way we can make constructive, well thought out informed decisions so we can improve her health because that's the bottom line is we want to improve our health. So I think I've covered all of that, right? So Mthfr, if you've got any questions about that by all means, comment, comment in the, uh, in the box, um, if you think that you are interested to find out what those symptoms might be, um, by all means, let me know.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the symptoms that I had was prematurely grain, um, and I found out that that can be related to not only Mthfr but as I was reading Dr Lynch's book, it can also be related to, um, you know, being a producer of hydrogen peroxide and that comes from stress. And so I found out that also stress was causing my premature aging, that really funny old school thing that we grew up with with like, you're going to cause all the hair on my head to go gray. It's true. You know what I mean? Like you actually can create super mutase are super, super periaxis days and it's actually an acts a lot like hydrogen peroxide and it literally can bleach your skin and things like that and you can actually end up getting prematurely gray. So it's pretty wild. Um, but anyway, um, and then also the Cilantro thing, but I don't want to go off on a tangent, but I also am not a fan of Cilantro, but it's because it tastes really weird to me and that too is also a genetic thing too.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, we'll save that for another video. Okay. So let's talk about the supplements that I'm currently taking. Okay. In order to manage my mthfr because essentially I want to become a better processor of things, right? Um, being in the military, being comment that are. And I've been exposed to a lot of stuff. I've been a lot of heavy metals, you know, when you're in the service, there's no such thing as a religious exemption. You can't just go, that's okay, I'll pass on that immunization, you get it. So, uh, regardless, uh, got a lot of those, did a lot of them. Things like that was out in combat environments around who knows what types of metals. So I had a lot of heavy metal stuff, so I want to make sure that my metabolic processes are working effectively so I can in fact key lane meaning to bind up and then get these things out of my system.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the first thing I started taking was a supplement that I knew that was going to have not only the correct things for me as a man, right, because you can get these in a women's formula as well because we need two different types of things, but I really love the fact that this not only has full lane, alright as methyl folate, but one thing that a lot of people don't pay attention to is that not only do you need methyl folate, but b, five and b, 12 are also important in the foliation pathways. And are methylating pathways B. Twelve is known as Cobalamin and B, five is thiamine or am I missing it up or it should be riboflavin. Let me see if I second guessed myself. Right? So it should be fine. I promise. I will. I promise I will hop on the Internet because you know Dr.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google knows all, but anyway it should be thiamine, right? And so anyway, those two things, um, I'm actually going to stop myself right there so I can make sure that I'm all legit on what I am saying because it's the b vitamins. I don't care how many times you've memorized all of these vitamins with all the b vitamins. It is ridiculous. And how well you forget. Okay. So Pam, pam though the neck acid, that's actually, it would be five. This is not diamond, excuse me. So pantothenic acid and cobalamin are necessary for pushing along the methylation pathway. And so when I, when I tell you to get a methylated full laid supplement for your multivitamin, you should also be looking at one that is methylator for both b12 and methylated for a year, Riboflavin, thiamine, your Panto Panto, phenic acid, because all of those b vitamins are cogs, if you will, in this methylation pathway.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's the reason why I'm going with the one that I'm taking now because this one in fact does have a plenty of vitamin D. folate is methyl folate, b12 as methyl cobalamin, iodine and zinc. Okay. And so this one, so far so good. Um, I know that I've got it. I've taken different supplements in the past, but I realized by reading that book, I probably should be considering other methylated sources as well. So that's the reason why I take that now is a multivitamin and now here's just a multitude of other things. I'll hurry up and try to run those down as to why I take them. What's my rationale behind them? Okay. I love the fact that Doterra came out with Copa e soft gels. I used to just do. And you still can get copd by Iba until you want to buy the soft gels, do one to two drops of the Copa Iba sublingually.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always added it with frankincense. This is huge for me. Okay. I want to make sure that I have both of those essential oils onboard. I also, you'll see if I open up my little, this is my, I jokingly call this, this is my old fart box. So, um, because I have a literally separate them out by the day because look at how many I take in a, in a daily basis and we'll go over all of them, but I also will take a DDR prime. The reason why I'm back to frankincense right now is just simply because I need to order my ddr prime, but um, I'll probably be adding pink pepper to that as well. So, uh, like I said, everything continues to improve, right? So those are like my basic ones. Okay. I found out that I'm also low in vitamin D and so I use a vitamin D dropper and then my good friend Jen who's probably watching this video of her and I a great talk about, uh, some magnesium.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnesium is another one that is critical for, uh, helping in the pathway of being able to appropriate and utilize vitamin D in the body. And so I'm going to also be looking into getting myself started with some magnesium as well. Now I've done a natural calm, but I really want one that's going to have some more bio availability. And so I am looking into one that I think has like five different types of magnesium in it because your body uses different forms of magnesium. There's different processes. And so, uh, once I dive into that one, I'll, I'll come back and I'll let you guys know about that. I always take vitamin C no matter what. Okay. If I'm feeling like I'm feeling right now, I'm a little scratching the back of my nose. I'll usually get the two. Um, I really enjoy this, that it's a two phase vitamin C, it's got a fast acting for stage and it has a time release second stage because with vitamin C it's one of those multivitamins or I should say it's one of those vitamins that's water soluble.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so if you don't necessarily, if your body says I don't need this right now, it'll just immediately start processing and put it out of your system. Okay? So that's why it's nice to have the time released to stage. And that's what I use. This one I can't stand, but I totally need. Niacin has been shown a actually an evidence based medicine. So clinical studies have shown that the use of Nice and at least 500 milligrams a day is good for improving your good cholesterol and so good cholesterol or Hdl, which is the high density lipoproteins portion of your cholesterol, has this cardio protective benefit. It actually can show a better chance of being able to protect against cardiovascular problems. And so, um, I would take notice and the only downside is, is that I have not gotten used to this. Uh, I still get what is called a flush.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So like you may have seen him maybe on other videos. Here's, will start getting red. My face starts getting ready to get a little itchy. It's kind of frustrating, but you know, if you want to take it at night or something like that, I just deal with it guys because I know that it's doing something good. There is one called a no flush version, but from what I understand, I talked to a couple of nutritionists and they said it's actually pretty ineffective. And so I have to just grin and bear it and take my. I just have to take it. I just have to take my I'm nice and to be happy with it. I was taking on the product by thorn. This one's called methyl guard plus what this one has an id. It has b five b, six more full late and be 12 in it.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is a great supplement to this in the sense that now we're making sure that we get all of those additional methylating pathway factors taken care of throughout the entire cycle. If you just Google methylation cycle, spelled m, e t h l r, excuse me, why l a t I o n you will see where all these factors come into place and so I really enjoy having this in hand because this will alarm and have all of those factors. Um, so I'm making sure that I'm methylating appropriately. That's, that has been a game changer for me. It's called methyl guard. It's a really, really good one. Of course I'm taking a fish oil. Okay. You can take Zio megabyte, doterra totally fine, but I need a lot. Okay. I have a history of cardiovascular stuff going on in my family and so I need one that's going to have at least a 650 on the EPA.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. Which is really, really cardio protective as well. Love these ones from a Nordic naturals. Okay. So I'll take two of those every single day, which gets me a roughly, you know, like somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2000 milligrams of fish oil a day. Okay. Let's see. Is that all my basics? They're going over all my basics. Oh, and then, yeah. So we'll go over these here as sort of like secondaries. These ones I take in the evening. This is red yeast rice with nattokinase nine. Oh by the way, guys, super food. I'm really, really phenomenal at being able to help support your circulation. It's a phenomenal, fantastic superfood. Uh, so the two of these together, I really enjoy red yeast. Rice does a great job of making sure that my cholesterol levels stay where they're supposed to without having to fuss with any of those regular conventional medication.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I really enjoy being able to take that and a cdot cystine or NAC is, it also has selenium molybdenum in it, uh, is, is really phenomenal for free radical protection. And so I take, not only do I take vitamin C, do I take vitamin E right? You can also consider starting with that yarrow and palm member. I did a video on that just about a couple of days ago. Your own palm are super high in antioxidants, critically important to the body because our bodies don't get a lot of free radicals. And so when we are literally just living like we don't even have to be exposed to toxins or consuming free radicals like by smoking, which is the most common way we're producing free radicals just by the simple virtue of metabolism. And so if we don't have free radicals in the body, we need to make sure that we have antioxidants which have these extra electrons or their electron rich and they freely donate their electronics, the free radicals and make them happy, make them a stable molecule so they don't go around and causing damage to our tissues.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it's super important to make sure that we're getting lots and lots of antioxidants. I, with all of these different things. I don't know, you know, my, my liver is operating appropriately, but I still take liver every single day. This is a desiccated liver. Um, it comes from a goodness gracious who is this? It's actually a paleo supplement, which I don't understand. You know, liver wouldn't be, but a, the perfect supplements. Okay. Um, I just take it because your liver with all the detoxifying, it needs constant support. And so therefore I take that. Plus I take milk thistle, milk thistle is a dietary supplement that is really great for being able to help support liver function. Okay. So milk thistle is really good if you want to add stuff like, you know, essential oil wise, Zenda Krinn, uh, you know, zendocrine is really great to add. And then also, um, juniper berry, it was also really good too for both, you know, sort of like that whole liver and kidney functions.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really what it helps out with. Then you've got a citrulline situation. I did not know, but I did some study on some citrus lane and the print were the primary function of the sitter. Lane is for um, you know, really good immune system function. But it's actually really cool that even the central lane is really great for like I'm acting as sort of like it's a carrier if you will. And so like I really love it in the system because it does a really wonderful job and making sure that that immune system runs real well. Reserve a trawl I think is a game changer for me. This one is really wonderful for cardiovascular support, but they're also saying that it's, it's an anti aging blind. Listen to what has gotten and it's got more polyphenols in it and it's got green tea, grapeseed, Osi, pomegranate, blueberry, noni fruits, Alfalfa and Hawthorne.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then it has regular Japanese, not what not we'd. And then it has the reserve at trawl which is pretty much half of it comes from that. Not We, but then it has vitamin C and lots of antioxidants and now one as well. And I really have felt like I started that one and I just felt better in terms of like, my energy levels were better. I'm sleeping much better again, so I really liked it. Here's something we don't get a lot every single day, which is Taurine, Taurine, which is, uh, you know, the, the root word of it as tour, which means bold, right? Men talking to you out there. Don't we want to be strong like bull for the rest of our lives? Well, that's probably why we need to go ahead and consider being on Tory. It's predominantly for your vision, but really this one is actually fantastic for just like bigger.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I honestly feel like, you know, my vigor has improved because of the addition of Taurine. And I'd take that, you know, I'm not going to give you guys, you guys gotta do your own research in terms of like your body, your gender, your age and all that sort of thing in terms of the recommendations for the dosages. But that's, I'm just giving you the supplements that I take. I don't know. This one's going to play knowing that we now have tumor of oil, but, uh, I really enjoy tumeric just by itself. This one's extra strength, so it's in a fight out cap if you will. I get like almost like 450 milligrams of tumeric every single day with this one and then also has black pepper in it as well. But this one has been great for those chronic, longstanding, like wonderful, uh, you know, discomfort so that I get via the military, but me and my military service, um, there, it's really great at being able to keep a lot of that stuff.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, the benefits of Tumeric, it's just phenomenal. Chromium, here's one that I didn't know about. So I read one study that said that chromium is the one thing, I don't know how they tested it for this, but in folks that have heart attacks, they said that people's chromium levels were actually low. Right? So like chromium, it's a extremely, not well known micro metal, if you will. But uh, but it is phenomenal for cardiovascular function and it's also really good for metabolic function. And so like there's this condition that we talk about as clinicians, if you will, and that's called a metabolic syndrome, right? So like, I don't know if it's a diagnosis, I can't remember if it's a diagnosis or not, but it's like five different factors that you take in consideration involving like height, weight, right? So like body circumference, like right at the waist, and then you look at cholesterol levels and you can look at, you know, glucose levels, which is the blood sugar and stuff like that.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Anyway, the people that have more of those being positive are more likely going to have chronic conditions in terms of like, you know, uh, a lot of those like need to be managed preventable disease type things. And so anyway, I'm. Chromium is really fantastic for being able to make sure that your body has all those wonderful things that let let those processes happen the way they should. So I'm totally a chromium. And then Glucomannan Glucomannan is a, it's Konjac root. And what it does is it actually like is crazy a absorptive of water. And it does a phenomenal job of actually absorbing water. And it sits in your gut and gives you like this early satiety feeling. So it's really nice to be able to use. I don't use it very often, but it's definitely in there. It helps with like, you know, they're just wanting to overeat.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of people say like, you know, start eating until you're about 80 percent full and then stop. I just liked the until I'm satisfied. And so I make sure that my portions are the appropriate size. That way I don't have a tendency to overeat necessarily. And once I eat that portion, that's it. I give my body some time to let those hormones let me know like, okay, you've had enough. That's good to go. But one last thing that I definitely recommend and I take. So it's really funny is that it's actually a, it's a liquid. It's a liquid deodorizer really. So it's chlorophyll. I actually take chlorophyll and yes, it stains like the Dickens. So you gotta be careful because it likes to stick to the bottle and it's staged just like chlorophyll. But uh, that and chlorella are fantastic at kelating heavy metals.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so that's why I said I wanted to like really look at those heavy metals that I'm taking or excuse me, I've taken in the past and what can I do to, like really bind those up and help my body process. Um, and so I recommend chlorella. It's a superfood. Spirulina is another great one to use. Um, and so these are all the things that I use. So I hopefully I haven't bored you with science, but, um, this is what I use and I want to make sure that you guys are aware of it. So comment below. This is just giving you my little personal testimony, if you will. These are all just what I'm using. I'm not necessarily saying that you need to go out and go buy this stuff right now. What I am saying is do your research. This is just here for you as a, uh, excuse me as a way to get started and, uh, and let's comment below in this thread, that way we can all like talk and be able to talk about like, you know, ways that we can help manage and, uh, and, and be able to look at a, if we do have Mthfr, how can we successfully manage ourselves that way we can have a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So anyway, it's been a pleasure as always. I will leave you with that and we will definitely talk to you again on the very next facebook live or youtube. Matter fact, I also got a podcast now, a unconventional wellness radio and I'll be starting up another podcast here very shortly. Then I promise I'll make the official announcement when it's, when it started. But anyway, love you guys.

It's trying to put you in the driver's seat. That'd be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted. I, I'm, uh, I'm Frank Ritz. I don't know if you guys know me, but I'm sort of like the high end, the scenes guy with jacqueline or website for Gosh, has it been like nine years now. And so, uh, and so I just came off a couple of really inspiring things and uh, and we're looking really into 2019 to provide some massive value for everybody who's been a fan of the Paleo Mama and everything that we have been doing or looking for a more natural way of being able to help take care of yourself and your family and your friends. And so I think it's about time for me to go ahead and sort of step out from behind the keyboard, if you will. And in terms of all of the support that I have provided and maybe start actually taking a little bit more of a mentorship and coaching role that, uh, that I've been wanting to\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life works in very strange but yet mysterious ways. And one day you finally have that Aha moment. And My Aha moment is actually been over the course of the last probably five years. Uh, I, to tell you a little bit of a backstory, I am a certified physician assistant and I'm also a service disabled combat veteran. And I have really just tried to find myself in terms of what do I do, uh, in, in how am I supposed to change the world because I've always wanted to do something like that. And so let me start by first telling you a, you know, I have no disclosures, if you will. I don't have anything that I necessarily am going to speak about. And all I'm going to try to do is just provide value and, uh, and tell you that there is hope. And that's, that's really what the biggest part of this messages that I just want you to, to, to, to have hope.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I started off in my childhood as believing that I was going to just simply be a doctor. That was it. That was what I was supposed to do with my life. Right? And I already figured that out. I figured out the whole world at eight years old. And so I, uh, I had this mission of always wanting to help people and that I was going to be a doctor. So I get to high school, fast forward a little bit and I'm doing everything then I think that I should be doing. I'm taking those classes that I should. I'm trying to get really good at science, all that kind of stuff. Right. And so then I go into college and this is where I started getting my first real experience of a kind of like, just at transition of starting to finally understand what it is to, to kind of be out there and being an adult.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I still had that feeling though. The common thread was I'm going to be a doctor, right? So I went through all four years and the way that it worked at my school was, you could be anything. I am a graduate of University of Florida, go gators. And uh, and so I had a degree in exercise physiology was pretty heavy in like, you know, health sciences and things like that. And I applied for a heist or excuse me, as I was applying for medical school, first of all, nine slash 11 happened my senior year of uh, upon graduation. So my senior semester I'm getting ready to go. Nine slash 11 happens. And then unfortunately, something even more tragic happened. My father passed away. And uh, and, and, and from that point forward I just turmoil erupted. And so, um, I still kind of sorta wanted to be a doctor, but of course it started becoming a little bit more, uh, aware of, you know, how real life can be.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I applied and I got some secondaries back if you will. And I just took forever. I didn't spend any time filling out my secondary is because the way the medical school works is at the time when I applied, you take your m cat, which is the, uh, the, the test to, you know, it's the college admission test if you will, for trying to get into school and then you apply primaries which are just like, you know, however many colleges you want to apply for. And then they look at your packet if you will, in the they'll up. You'll usually do some secondary for most schools. And so secondary is came back on in about two, three schools. And I just never filled them out really. Well actually, let's just face it. I never saw them out at all because I turned to alcohol and I turned to food, um, in order to, to combat and deal with my depression about losing my dad.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, um, I finally filled it out and it turned it in. And I actually got a phone call from the board when I actually got an email from the board about my packet and saying that we would have loved to accept to you. You seem like you were very qualified, but we've already filled up our class and so that ship sailed. And so, um, at that point I started going, what do I do now? Right. So for the last 20 years I was supposed to be a doctor and so now what do I do? So I started getting this feeling of, um, let me, let me go and use my degree. So I graduated, I finished college and then I started working at a health fitness center and worked my way up through that. Became a general manager of one of the stores. But then I got this inkling I can't be the only member of my family that hasn't served in the military, actually come from where my father served.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, you know, both of my brothers served in the military. And so I said, I can't, I don't want to be the only one that hasn't served in the military. And so I went and I saw a recruiter come to find out that, uh, you know, military recruiter ended up being an army, rolled out the red carpet. Obviously they were accepting everybody because of nine slash 11. And uh, there was just one problem. I was very overweight when I left college. I was, must have been probably about 265 pounds because like I said, I drownded my sorrow and alcohol and pizza and that's pretty much all I ate because of nine slash 11 and then subsequently losing my dad. And so I was 265 pounds and I was extremely well qualified to join the service. But for one reason I was drastically overweight. And so the recruiter wanting to work with me and he said, here's the deal.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got to be able to do this. And he laid out a good plan and goal for me. And I started working at it and I started realizing that it made me feel good. It actually made me feel good to start focusing on my food, start focusing on the fact that I needed to stop drinking so much and that I also needed to be able to get out and enjoy the sunshine. And so I started doing some really good army training. Started putting a backpack on, just walking, started out slow, just started functionally moving because I was terribly out of shape. I probably couldn't even have finished a half of a mile walk when I first started. I couldn't even do, but maybe two pushups. I mean, I was really, really out of shape. And so slowly over the course of the next couple of months I started working out and I come to find out that I started getting really good at it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, um, I started kind of like literally peeling back the layers of the onion and I found out that I'm actually not too bad at trying to be good. And so I, uh, started really getting into what do I want to do when I'm in the military? Well, that was where that common bug of wanting to help people came back. And so I enlisted into the army as a combat medic and I was allowed to actually join because I ended up losing over 55, almost 60 pounds in order to be able to actually join the service. So I joined the service and I shipped off to basic training, finished basic training. I'm probably one of the best experiences you'll hear, a couple of experience that I probably would never do again, but one of the best experience that I would never do again in my life.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, but at that time when I graduated basic training, I showed up to kind of like my first assignment, if you will, and I have the opportunity because of the fact that I graduated high school to go ahead and go onto officer candidate school to become a commissioned officer in the US military or into the United States army. I said, you know, I had to call a couple of mentors that I had made throughout the time and I even called my recruiter and I said, what do you guys think? Well, um, I decided to go ahead and go the officer route. And so, um, I went through something called officer candidate school, which was a 14 week at the time, of course, a much more stringent than a basic training. You learn a lot about how to be a leader and sort of started, started pulling those heartstrings about like a training you on the fact that you know you're not a born leader but you are.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can be created one based on your choices and based on the things that others can teach you. So I finished officer candidate school and then I was sworn in as a newly promoted second lieutenant in the army, but my job was not related to medicine whatsoever. They started me off as a ordinance officer and I do remember like as if it was yesterday, I turned to the other folks in my unit at school and I said, what in the, you know, what? Fill in the blank is ordinance and come to find out that it's actually just maintenance. It's maintenance and munitions, meaning that I was responsible for the maintenance of trucks and I was responsible for the maintenance of weapons, needless to say, totally and needs of the army thing. Not what I was intending to serve my country, but I embraced it right.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I was still serving. And so I did that wrap for about four years. Fast forward now to my first unit that I deployed with. I was part of the 101st, uh, came back from an overseas tour in a, in Korea. And uh, and so I said I got to get back into medicine. So during my deployment I actually started shadowing a, both an md as well as my, what is called the Battalion Pa, this battalion or Squadron Pa as a, as a, as a person in charge of the health of a particular unit. Uh, just so happened that we were about three to 500 folks inside of our unit and I just watched him work and I just simply said, okay, I think I finally get it. This is what I'm supposed to do in medicine. So I had the opportunity to apply for the interservice physician assistant program, which is all branches come together and they all study together and then they go and learn their clinicals for the following year.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's a two year program. First Year is what we call drinking from a fire hose where you learn all of the medical sciences that you could possibly jam into your brain in one year. Probably ended up taking three to five tests a week and somehow survived, but during that, that's when I met Jackie and so she joined me after we were married for my last final trimester of my first year of PA school and then she was with me from that point forward through my clinicals, which we moved to another place and finish that out and so that was it. You know, I graduated from physician assistant school and I was like, that's what I guess I'm supposed to do for the rest of my life. And so I practiced as a PA, absolutely enjoyed it, learned a lot about soldiers, learned a lot about medicine, absolutely enjoyed what I did, but then my time in the army caught up with me and my first deployment, especially the, the situation that happened or the couple of situations that happen started really catching up with me and I was really, really good at being able to hide it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's one thing that you learn in the military, have something called military bearing. You can absolutely have chaos going on in your life and you're not supposed to show it. And then on top of that, you know, as a senior enlisted, okay, so somebody who's been an enlisted soldier in the army for a while as well as officers were not supposed to show any type of weakness because our soldiers pick it up really, really quick. And so I was able to bury the entire understanding of what happened in my first deployment. Then I'll tell you that story now. So in my first deployment, uh, we were on a mission that, uh, we were supposed to just go out and do what was called route clearance as well as, uh, some route redirection, if you will. That was what this mission was in particular for. So, uh, we kind of rolled out, if you will, from the wire and, uh, and we went on our mission and stuff like that.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then we kinda did what is called a hasty stop. And so we came to an intersection of one of the larger, uh, routes that were in the bag, that area of Iraq for a, the beginning of the war. So this is like around the 2004, actually more so 2005 timeframe. So, you know, two years we were like coming with the second we were coming in with the second wave, if you will, of what happened. We got kicked off in late 2002 early, 2003 after, you know, nine slash 11 had happened. And so we come to a hasty stop and my lead gun track, the ncl calls me a [inaudible]. I was the platoon leader. I was the mission leader, if you will. And, uh, and he said, sir, I think that we're dealing with a couple of wires that I see out there, uh, in roll over them.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, come to find out that we actually were on top of them to tell you the quick story. But during that time I actually went and I walked up to his truck and I grabbed my binoculars and I'm looking at it and I go, you're absolutely right. I completely agree with you. I see exactly what you're saying. And so for some strange reason an out of body experience happened and it was definitely something that I was a. I was a brand new officer and I made sort of one of those judgement mistakes. But thank God there's a good news story out of this. But I made a judgment mistake and I actually walked with him out to go see these wires. For some reason we thought it was a good idea. I don't know why folks. I wish I could tell you that probably every other brain cell was telling me don't do this.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a dumb idea. But instead I, I kinda just like instinct takeover and probably put caution and judgement into the wind. And I walked up there with him and so I. and so we see the wires and stuff like that. And then finally, after what seemed like probably an eternity, but it may have just been seconds that passed by, I grabbed him and I yank him back and I go, what are we doing there? Some expletives here, but what are we doing? I grabbed them and I pull them back to the truck. Well, we call something called Explosive Ordinance disposal. And if you've ever seen the movie, Oh golly. What's it called? The, uh, the hurt locker. This is big on Explosive Ordinance Disposal Disposal folks. And so it just so happens that a particular truck that was designed at the time to dig up dirt and stuff like that and take a look at things, it was a passing by because it was finishing up its mission.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so we kind of flag them down and we said, hey, would you do us a favor and just take a look at this? We believe that we're dealing with an IED. And so they look at it, they start digging after about, I don't know, must have been 15, 20 minutes, maybe I'm the person who was in charge of that vehicle comes over and talks to me and said, wow, he's like the, did you know the size of the, the piece of ordinance that we're dealing with? And of course I tell him, I said, no, we just saw the wires and all that kind of stuff. He goes, well, you're dealing with a pressure plate ied and the size of the round that's underneath it as a one five, five round. Okay. So let's, let's explain what that even means, right? So one, five, five round folks is the type of thing, if you've ever seen the gigantic tank looking thing with a big old canon on it, that is an artillery style of vehicle.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what that is designed to do as hurl a bullet over the course of not just feet or meters or yards, it's supposed to be up to miles away and a one, five, five rounds. The standard round size of what one of these massive tank like artillery vehicles fires. So needless to say, it packs a large punch. It is probably a couple of steps underneath like some of like our rockets that we can fire that can actually decimate like a, like a square kilometer. And we stood and we were standing on it and we come to find out that not only were we standing on it but it was also pressure plate Id folks that could have died that day. And I didn't and I'm eod came out. We called them up afterwards because we identified that it was an explosive device. Eod comes out and of course I tried to put on the whole, you know, a facade of everything's all good, everything's great and let me go ahead and blow up this piece of ordinance so they let me do it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was kind of cool. They had a little robot that it went out at attached a piece of c, four, two and they let me push the button and I watched it blow up. And then of course another sense of doom fell over me because I said, wow, I could have been me in that gigantic mushroom cloud right there. And it wouldn't have just been brown and we're probably had that wonderful color that, that would have been the rest of me. And so, um, you know, we, we went back and we tried to decompress and stuff like that and there were some other things that had happened while we were over in Iraq that you just don't forget. And so, excuse me. So I come back. Good news was though, is that first of all, I made it home. And then secondly, um, I was accepted to physician assistant school. And so I show up for physician assistant school with your classic ptsd symptoms, you know, uh, at the time our first year was down in San Antonio, Texas. That's where we went to our first year during PA school. And they had\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the same exact barriers that we used during my deployment. I'm to direct the traffic. Like I was saying, I was on a highway. I remember it specifically. My hands were sweating. I was gripping the steering wheel with all of that. I had inside of both of my arms sweating profusely and a driving probably on a 65 mile an hour highway. I'm driving like 17 miles an hour, sweating. People are honking their horns behind me and stuff like that. And the reason why I felt that way was because of these same exact barriers that our enemy at the time would use to actually explode into our vehicles to try to kill us. Nightmares had them. I'm pulling away from people, Kinda could do it, couldn't do it. Of course, when I was at on-duty, everything was all good. When I was at home, I was by myself, um, turn to alcohol, self-medicated, all those things. Right? So I say that because somehow by the grace of God, I was able to still finish PA school, but one of the largest questions that I had was that I met Jackie and we got married somehow. She, uh,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she's still, um,\\n\\nSpeaker 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saw something in me.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish I could pause it because I need some water. But, um, finished school, go to another unit, um, ended up in a Fort Stewart, Georgia. Thank you. Ben. Ended up in Fort Stewart, Georgia and then I started seeing soldiers as a, uh, as a certified pa and it was therapeutic. And so, um, and so she's awesome by the way. And so, uh,\\n\\nSpeaker 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alright,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like I finally have myself composed there and so it was therapeutic to be able to talk to soldiers about their experience as well. Excuse me. I was offered everything under the sun. I was offered any type of anti depression medication. I was offered, um, you know, opioid medications for my physical conditions and things like that. Passed it all up, drove on. But then I started looking into integrative health and I had the opportunity to do this while I was still on active duty. So I had some really great physical therapists that were doing some integrative measures. I had some, uh, some chiropractors that I had the pleasure and, and, and just blessing and of working with. And I started realizing while I was still on active duty that I was allowed to actually use natural methods instead of conventional medicine methods to manage my ptsd in my, um, you know, musculoskeletal conditions.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at the same time. All right, so let me, let me parallel this. That the same time that I'm starting to get this bug about doing this. Jackie is creating the Paleo Mama website and so she's looking into how to create whole clean food for us to be able to eat, raising the kids with whole clean food, raising me if you will, with whole clean food and just um, and, and just, it all kind of started weaving together finally. So back in 2009, I think I did another deployment. It was my final deployment, but this time I was on the provider side and not the, I was still a soldier, but I mean of course I was on the provider's side, not the soldier side. And so through my workings with integrative health, I was able to start implementing these things because while we're down range, meaning like while we were deployed, I can't give medications to soldiers that are going to stop them from being on target.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what I mean? Like, I'm not allowed to give them psychotropic medications because they may cause drowsiness and, you know, feelings of numbness and detachment from their surroundings. So I had to avoid anti depression medications, but these are men and women that are like, you know, possibly on their second, third, even fourth deployment because at the time we were super embedded in the Middle East and uh, and, and we were fighting like just chronic battle fatigue. Right. So like even coming back for 12 months or 15 months, we usually just recycling and just returning back to the Middle East. And so that was not an option. Um, I was not allowed to utilize opioid medications. Um, I wasn't allowed to give these prescriptions, you know, because they were dealing with chronic, you know, not just battle fatigue. And now we're dealing with like, you know, chronic knee pain and back pain and shoulder pain and hip pain and this pain and that pain.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can't give these medications either. And so I had to get creative with how am I going to manage the stress of the environment both in a mental and physical way. And yet still be able to have them be able to complete the mission. So I had to get creative and I started developing these ways and so then my physical and mental conditions caught up with me. And, and at the time this was now a fast, or excuse me, rewind that a little bit to 2014 or 2013. I just, I couldn't do surface anymore. And so, uh, I was medically retired because of my conditions. And, uh, and subsequently I decided like, well, what do I do from here? Right? Like now I'm a, I'm a PA and I still want to help people. So what in the heck do I do? So I went back into being a Pa of course, but this time I said, I'm not going to do conventional medicine.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to do, you know, go see somebody and try to fix problems. Instead I'm going to actually sit down with people and talk with them about their problems and start practicing a lot of these things that I started learning in the military about trying to manage things without conventional medicine ways. So I started working for an integrated health clinic. It's kind of cool. We worked with a chiropractor as well, so I learned even more things about massage therapy and reiki healing and, and, and in acupuncture and I'm just all of these really awesome things that are out there that are unconventional and a, and are still extremely useful when used in, in certain ways. And so anyway, I'm at the same time, like I said, Jackie's website is starting to really gain some mats of traction. Uh, she's really exciting. A lot of folks, people are looking to her for do it yourself things and recipes and how to eat right and all these things that she's implementing with our family. And so, like I said, we start stitching and weaving together this basket or rope even more if you will. And so I said to myself like, you know,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the city that we were living in the city that I grew up in a and it just wasn't doing it for us. Like we didn't want to be in, in a, you know, the city that we're living anymore. So I look at her at one point and I go, if you can live anywhere in the country, wherever would you think about it? And so that's when we started talking and we come to find out that we both love western North Carolina. And so I said, okay, we need a means to get there, we're going to need the money to get there. So what do we do? So all of a sudden this thing within that week pops into my inbox, um, you know, and, and it says that there's a job available for a physician, assistant instructor in western North Carolina. We're opening up a brand new school, it's going to be the satellite school of this other school near Charlotte and uh, and we need a PA or we need some PA's to go in there and in launch this and start teaching pa school,\\n\\nSpeaker 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I apply and I get the job.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we bundle everything up again and we have only lived in, we've only lived where we were living for what, five months maybe. And so we were like packing up again. So. Hi, welcome back to the military. Um, so we pack up and we move out here, don't know a soul. And a, I started teaching well at that point, that's when Jackie, founder, Tara, and some other things that she has been working on online and, uh, really started gaining some massive traction at this point, um, about her financial success that she was appreciating through her website. And so I remember at one point I looked at her and I go, well, okay, so this thing that you got going on, it's pretty awesome and you've grown it exceptionally well. And uh, you know, were you thinking about going with this? So she looks at me and she goes, I'd love for you to come on and work with me.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I told her, I said, well, you know, being the pragmatic than I am, I had to say, that sounds all well and good. It scares the living, you know, what out of me. But if you can replace my income as a professor in PA school, I'll come home and work with you. And she did. And so I'm now, excuse me, present day. I've been working with this cow. Um, for the last three and a half years and I haven't had to work in practice since. And so through that time we have been able to really dive into our, I shouldn't say I've been able to dive into, although I will speak about Jackie here in a couple of moments because she deserves a great deal of credit, um, about my recovery through ptsd. But, um, I started digging a little bit more it to the veterans administration system.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful System when it works, right? Like, so they are. Everybody has a passion for helping veterans and we love that and we think that that's an amazing benefit that we have. The thing is though, is that like, you know, it's a little bit, it can be a little clunky at times and you know, there's certain types of modalities, if you will, for being able to be treated that aren't covered by veterans administration services. And so chiropractic medicine worked really well for me. Um, acupuncture worked really well for me. Come to find out the va actually will cover that. So that was pretty awesome. Um, but then I started moving over here in western North Carolina and if you haven't been here, it's a very natural community. Um, at the same time also we started getting this little crazy bug about like, well, let's be farmers to like, so like we went from this like let's do organic food or clean food and then why can't we start doing it ourselves?\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like why can't we start making our own food? And so that whole thing was starting to kind of come to reality and crystallizing. And so, um, we had a hobby farm where we first started when I was teaching pa school and then we subsequently moved out of there and move north of Asheville and now we have a fully fledged farm here. And the, the, the agricultural piece of my overcoming things has been remarkable. There are now studies folks that are showing the benefit of combat veterans or veterans getting their hands into the soil, feeling those nutrients and those minerals that are able to really help with not only mental but even possibly physical conditions. And so I'm here to tell you that that's true. Farming has been therapeutic for me. There is this fancy term that we're not throwing around called Agra therapy, um, when we're talking about veterans and it's been monumental for my mental health.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, something about getting into, you know, I'm not a big gardener but I still work with the land, um, but something about working with the land and working with animals has just been phenomenal for me. And so that's another piece that was always kind of working in there besides these nonconventional methods that has really helped. And lastly wants something that has really helped. Well, excuse me. So let's, that's, that's the, you know, so that's the piece in terms of like our nutrition, you know, and then I started functionally moving better with the farm and getting active and getting outside. One thing about western North Carolina is, it's unbelievable. The hiking trails and just being in nature and having like just this big back yard here. Um, so that was really helpful. I started sleeping better and I want to show you how to do that eventually.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I started actually getting like eight wonderful hours of sleep at night. No nightmares, no. Um, you know, abrupt wake ups, if you will. Um, I was arrested, I was able to reduce stress. I was able to manage my anxiety, um, through both, you know, some conventional, I'm convinced more conventional ways, but a lot of unconventional ways. And then we started to removing toxins from our home. You know, we started like eating off of the right things, using the right utensils, using the right food products, getting rid of these processed foods, not spraying anything at our farm and raising things in our organic methods. Uh, all of these things, you know, getting out and getting sunshine, you know, like started doing all these things and through these baby steps I've been able to over come any, well, most of my ptsd symptoms, I still carry some with me, you know, like Jackie can attest to the fact that when I'm sitting in a restaurant I got to sit in a particular spot, my house, good luck breaking in.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like Fort Knox. Uh, so, you know, I still have some nuances about me, but I guess don't we all. But uh, but, but, but by far I would definitely say that I'm, I'm feeling pretty solid about where I'm at today. Here's the one piece that I'm going to do my best not to lose it because I already started losing it a little bit. I have to say something. So now I'm starting to lose it. So if you have mental health issues, if you have depression, if you have anxiety, if you have anything right, you have a fear of whatever. You have a support structure in your life. You may have a parent, you may have a brother and he may have a sister. You might have a cousin. You've got somebody who loves you. They are imperative to your wellbeing. The problem is though, is that by design, we as human beings are extremely not humble. We're terrible at sharing our hearts. And I sit here today to let you know that it works. You have to share what's going on in here and what's going on in here with somebody. You can't keep it to yourself because if you do, it'll eat you up from inside up.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackie has been that for me. I'll keep it together. I promise you just need somebody who will be willing to accept that abrasiveness and who will accept the harshness and allow you to pour out of you what you have inside\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you know why it's not going to happen once it happened a dozen times, but it's got to happen over time. We're not creatures. Excuse me. I use the analogy that we're not light switches, right? Like you can't just go and just go wake up all of a sudden the next day and just go. That said, I'm going to change myself. Right? Like you. You may wake up at the motivation to do so, but it's going to take time because it took you time to get there, and so you need to find somebody who can be your social support and your social structure who loves you. That's huge, who loves you and is willing to accept you even when you're at your worst. Find that person in your life. It's crucial. If you get nothing from this video, find someone in your life you know that you can do that with, could just be an old high school friend that you facebook message them, you know what I mean?\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text them if you have their phone number, just say like, I need somebody and we always had that moment where you know, I can share something with you, but reach out. Find somebody. I'm somebody who is going to be loud to be transparent and allow you to literally off gas, you know, and and just and just be your worst and they'll just look at you and tell you everything's fine and everything's all good and be willing to accept you for everything that you are. Because what we need to do is what I've realized is in my own mental health, trying to push away, those are those characteristics that I didn't like. I found out that they came at me even harder with double or triple or even five times the effort I would push away, push away, push away, and would come back even harder. So what I've had to realize is that these are all characteristics that make me up and I have to embrace them. And so instead of, you know, proverbially poking at the line, we need to instead embrace and give that line a hug. And so, um, I say all that because support, support structure is, is worth it. I mean, I hate statistics. I know that statistics wake us up, but statistics don't give names and it's a shame that there's a statistic of 22 veterans a day commit suicide.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those 22 people, how many hundreds, how many dozens to hundreds of people do they affect that are still living.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's, don't get me wrong, the 22 a day is an alarming number. It shouldn't even be one a day, but it is not just those 22 that are ultimately affected. Like I said, I'm trying not to sound callous when I say this. I don't want it to be one a day, but it's, you know, w we forget about also possibly the people that survived them, right? Because I always say that to my patients. I've said it for years is that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and that we've allowed it to get to the point where we're actually thinking about harming ourself. Um, some of you guys that might be watching this, some of you guys that, you know, could be on the call, I'm just going to be real. Somebody out there right now watching this may have had thoughts of harming themselves. And I tell you, find someone, if you share your heart, you're gonna be vulnerable and yes, you're gonna, you know, probably not be your best self, but the payoff is huge. Guys, the payoff could be life changing. It can be life saving. So I urge you find someone that can um, that can help.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, you know, I just want you to know that, um, that there's hope. Sorry, don't know where the salt gottman from, but wow, you when you talk about it enough and sure enough, there's always this little tiny bit that like bowl stir up inside of you. But I just want you to know that as a conventionally trained provider who has been practicing medicine on my own, excuse me, I don't feel like I've had it, but I definitely know that we can help. And so\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38:59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't give up right there is hope for you, for your family, for your friends, whomever. We all know somebody. I jokingly say that like mental health is like the Kevin Bacon, you know the six degrees of separation game. Like we know somebody who has been affected or we are somebody who is being affected and we have to bind together and we have to create community. Again. That's where our relationships are. Excuse me. That's where our society is lacking. I just got finished with this really great, very inspiring conference that was put together here in my neck of the woods and providers from around the country. Matter of fact, medical providers, doctors, Dietitians, nurse practitioners, you know, those sorts of folks came together to talk about nutrition. Like how is it that some statistics that I can throw at you, right? Because they only are supposed to design to like catch attention because they are powerful in that regards. But like let's get rid of these statistics, right? It is 80 percent plus of Americans with chronic disease. There are actually preventable. I'll just let that sink in for a second. Eighty percent of Americans and our healthcare costs are because of preventable disease.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighty percent. If I take five people, four of them have chronic illness.\\n\\nSpeaker 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40:41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, what are we doing to ourselves, right? Like this has got to stop. We've got to stop eating and not taking care of ourselves in this way. And so I want to help. And so I him devising a way to get what is going on in here out to you guys and I want to make sure that we can reach you in such a way that you can apply these things immediately. Um, so I asked the question, where do you see yourself in your wellness journey or in your way of trying to be more natural? Where do you see yourself in the next year?\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 41:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because a lot can happen in a year and, and we want to help you do that. And so, uh, I'm going to be teaming up with a lot of these really great connections that I've made, other medical doctors and other folks who are wellness experts and I'm going to bring to you something that is going to be real, Raul probably unedited at times and, uh, extremely valuable and easy because that's what's important, right? I consider it, I can tell you just for example, I can tell you about food all day long about why you shouldn't eat this and why you shouldn't eat this and why you should eat this. But the fact of the matter is, is like does it taste good? Right? Because like if something doesn't taste good, it's not like it's going to be nutritionist because it's not even going to go into our mouth.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 42:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so we need to uncover and peel away the pieces of this onion to make it to where it's like useful for you. And so, uh, that is my goal. That is my mission. Like I said, I've been weaving this together or I shouldn't say that I've been leaving it because let's face it, no, I haven't. Um, it's, it's a, it's a story that I've just had to live out a or had the pleasure to live out, but now it's finally all coming together and so we want to teach you about food and, and functional movement and how to get better sleep and detoxing. We want to teach you all these things. So I, I just, I realized that, uh, all of these things happen because I want to be the conduit, if you will, of the testimony to be able to bring it to you. They'll let you know. There's hope that you don't have to become a statistic. You don't have to wonder why are you a slave to so many things and let you break free and let you be empowered and let you understand that there's hope.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 43:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm excited. Can't say you don't see it, but I'm scared. I'm scared for a good reason. I have fear of what's to come because I don't want it to go really well. And, uh, you know, I just want to make sure, excuse me, that it's something that you can always provide value. And so a lot of guys, um, I'm planning on actually starting a podcast, I promise it won't be this long, but I'm going to bring a lot of these subject matter experts on my podcast and, uh, and, and really just try to meet you where you're at, you know, whether it'd be on your computer, you listened to me in your car, whatever. I want you to be able to hear this information and get some value, but most importantly, help you figure out the way to apply it into your life so you can start making the changes you've always wanted and started living the natural life that you deserve and stop being statistics.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 44:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So like I said, love you guys. Can't wait to broadcast to you here in the near future. And please stay tuned to this website because we're bringing in big changes as well. And, uh, and we're gonna meet you where you're at. And we're going to have the beginning of the most healthiest, 2019 and we possibly can. And beyond, and so, uh, if you want to comment below, share your story, please let us know and those comments below because stories are powerful. You have a story, you are a story and a, and we need to bond together no matter what way it takes a, we need to bond together and we need to be willing to get each other's back. And most of all we need community. And so I urge you, please share your story, let us know how we can help and then help each other. And I cannot wait to see what this whole thing as we roll it out is going to do for you guys. And, and all of us saying, yeah, I'm just, I'm super excited. I'm just about to explode out of his chair by. I can't wait. So I hope you enjoyed this and I appreciate you giving me your time and thanks for letting me tell my story flush you.\\n\\n&nbsp;\", 'length': '', 'date': '2018-11-06', 'medium': 'audio', 'formality': 'Intermediate', 'source': 'Unconventional Wellness Radio', 'source_id': 'https://unconventionalwellnessradio.castos.com/feed', 'web_url': 'https://episodes.castos.com/unconventionalwellnessradio/UW-Ep-6-Final.mp3', 'image_url': 'https://episodes.castos.com/unconventionalwellnessradio/images/frankpod-e1537033621399.jpg'}\n",

It's trying to put you in the driver's seat. That'd be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone and welcome to the unconventional wellness radio broadcast. Today I have the distinct pleasure of bringing Jackie Ritz, author of everyday natural and also the CEO of The Paleo Mama.com website, and what really, especially she's my wife, and we're here today to talk to you about gut health. So sit back, relax and enjoy!\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well podcast, and we cannot wait to bring you this show today. It is going to be a great deal of fun. We're going to talk about gut health today and that right? Yes. So excited and talk about that. Well, the reason why we want to talk about your gut is because honestly guys, you have probably heard before that gut health is appropriate and necessary for proper overall health and honestly, if you don't take care of yourself in that regards, it is going to lead to a slew of different problems and so really, really want to talk about gut health today because we think it's foundational and honestly a lot of people may not even be focusing on what might be going on with their gut and wondering why they're having this multitude of different symptoms and problems. Well, and wasn't it hippocrates who said all health originates in your gut or let thy food be thy medicine.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, so. Well, and then of course you can't necessarily say that. He said because I heard that someone said that hippocrates might not have been the author of that, but needless to say, there are truth in both of those regardless of who actually said it. And so we want them to start off with some of the ways that we can. Let's start off with describing what the microbiome or what the actual little microbes that are inside of our gut, what they are responsible for. Okay. Because there has been lots of studies done in the last couple of decades that have shown a lot of different originations of situations that arise from issues within the gut to include like mental health can actually be affected if you do not have an appropriate gut response. There's a big large amount of data and large amount of studies being produced that actually show the link between the gut and mental health and emotions.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. So one time it was extremely. When we look at our gut, we don't necessarily think about what it really is. So let's talk about the function of the Gut, right? So we start off from the mouth going all the way to the back side. It is literally one long tube that is wrapped around itself many times over, has a couple of different areas that it's got to pass through, but it's entire purpose is to extract the nutrients out of our food in order to be able to deliver those nutrients into the bloodstream to make it to every cell in our body. Well, with that being said, when you think about how essential oils may service every cell of the body, it is absolutely true about the foods that you eat are going to serve as every cell of your body, good, bad or indifferent, and so we need to consider where the actual nutritive value of the food is really where the where the rubber meets the road, if you will, and so once it passes through, the mouth goes into the stomach.\\n\\nSpeaker 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it starts the purpose of digestion and make it into even smaller, more molecular size particles. But once it really gets down into that small intestine is where a lot of the magic happens and everyone in their small intestine has a micro biome and the microbiome is actually a types of microorganisms that are currently living inside of your gut. There are bacteria that as part of that microbiome inside of your gut, bacteria is a E Coli. And you know, when you hear the word E Coli, you might be thinking about the bad forms of E Coli that you may have heard on the news, uh, you know, with undercooked beef or something like that from a restaurant causing a really, really bad reaction and a person that may in fact make them hospitalized. Unfortunately a couple of people have died from that bad type of E Coli. Well, that is a subtype of E Coli, whereas the E Coli that we currently have along with some other things like, you know, acidophilus and some backdoor species, like what those are as those are beneficial bacteria that help digest the food.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a byproduct is also vitamin K. and so anyway, I say all that because there is this thing of like a scale, right? So you've got good bacteria technically battling with bad bacteria or other bad flora inside of the God and there is a constant battle for space going on and so when we want to do is we want to make sure that our microbiome remains a with you bacteria, our good bacteria, and so we need to ensure that those bacteria are the ones that are proliferating because that would lead to a healthy body overall. There was one particular study that I can think of that was in the Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology talking about how having beneficial good bacteria can actually improve the immune system. It can improve symptoms of depressive feelings or even an anxiousness. It can actually help regulate the weight in a positive way and other many numerous benefits.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you want to go check that out, that is online. The researcher's name is Dr E.M. Quigley. And so I just wanted to talk about that as well. So if you have symptoms of an unhealthy gut, excuse me. If you have symptoms of an unhealthy gut, we want to. We want to shed some light on those right now. And so let's just, the fact that we have a lot of stress, I mean, in our world now, there are so many different ways that we can be stressed out. We can absolutely just get into our car, have a relatively okay morning and all of a sudden as soon as we're driving, we're stressed and all of those types of things can lead to poor gut health. And so if you're having some of these symptoms, you might want to go ahead and consider, do we need to go ahead and take a look at our gut health?\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if we have like, you know, upset stomach feeling. So like that is going to be something like your bloating or your indigestion or even, you know, frequent trips to the bathroom or not. So frequent trips to the bathroom or even, you know, the occasional symptoms of reflux. There might be stress as well as some issues going on inside of your gut. Let's talk about processed foods to. Okay, processed foods are really being consumed in our family or excuse me, in our, um, in our society in a very high rate process. Foods are those foods that require some sort of change or have had chemicals added to them to ensure their preservation for years to come a diet, a typical diet of an American family, they eat in excess of 50 percent processed foods and the crazy thing about it is that there's also something called an ultra processed food and ultra processed food or those things that like we aren't really able to even say that they're even food like we may not even be able to say that they're actually food because they're sort of like the superhero of processed foods and so this might actually lead to a lot of different issues with weight management and stuff like that.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that you might be receiving or or may get from inappropriate gut health as you might actually have issues with sleep, you might not be able to get the sleep very well or you're being woken up throughout your normal sleep time. It's because of the fact that there is actually a regulatory hormone which is Serotonin. That and Melatonin play into getting appropriate sleep. The downside is, is that actually if you have a situation where you have a long standing issue with sleep than you may in fact actually not be creating the amounts of Serotonin that you need for your body to be able to rest appropriately. One of the things that I, this is another, this is number five, but one of the things that I've never, never really known about was, uh, you know, before I went to school to become a PA was skin disturbances or skin issues. Right? So like when skin gets irritated and things like that, I had no idea that, that could actually be related to the foods that you eat now. There's a lot more data in that because we're talking about over almost a decade ago where I actually learned that, but now it's like really becoming forefront in the last probably three to five years that we know that certain foods can, can be trigger foods, if you will. That'll cost skin irritations in people.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to butt in. I know you're on a roll over here, frank, but um, I can actually attest to that when I eat a lot of grains and gluten, my chicken skin kind of rears its ugly head and so if you guys don't know what that is, it's those bumpy skin that you can have on your upper arms and your thighs and they've linked it to different food sensitivities in particular, gluten and grains, grains and gluten that haven't been prepared properly, which, you know, I kind of talk more about that later, but that totally is related all to your gut. So if you have that same thing going on, I would call it chicken skin. I don't know what the real name for it is. I love to use a little coconut oil, kind of rub it down a little bit, but you're masking. The bigger problem in that is just, you know, balancing your gut and taking good care of your body. Tara Tosas. Plrs. Thank you.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keratosis Pilaris. He said that's, that's the, that's the condition of chicken skin. But anyway, so the last couple of things I want to talk about before we kinda move into how we can go ahead and ensure that we are maintaining a healthy gut is we want to look at some, you know, uh, immune, uh, situations that might arise as well. So like we may in fact actually have issues with foods that are, you know, and not only are we becoming intolerant to these foods because a lot of what we eat these days is really not food at all, but we may actually, we may also have issues with getting the appropriate nutrients as well as creating situations where our gut is becoming like super inflamed because of these types of foods that are processed and ultra processed,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overactive immune system. Right?\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so therefore it's going to cause us to actually have an overactive immune system. And so we really want to let you know that there is hope and that there is things that we can do to ensure the wellness of our gut.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So we'll give you guys a little bit of a plan to repair your gut. And I think everyone should do this. You might be listening to me like, oh my God is fine, I don't have any issues. I'll, uh, you, you still need to, you know, go through different times in your life or in your year. I, we kind of do it three, two to three times a year. We'll do a cleanse where we really just heal our gut, but we want to share with you guys a plan for moving forward and healing your gut. And so it's super easy to remember why you're going to remove foods too. You're going to replace foods three, you're going to repair your body with supplements and then for, you're going to rebalance with probiotics. And so the first one is removed certain foods. And I think frank touched on that briefly, but, um, if you're new to the whole real food, let me kind of break it down for you.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eating real food is eating food that is as close to natural as possible. It's, you know, think about how our ancestors ate and how people back in the, you know, 500 BC, eight, you want to eat food that is GMO free, that is not synthetic, that doesn't have additives, additives to it, and that especially stay away from conventional dairy products. So these are the top, you know, toxic exposures that you can have in relation to food. And of course, you know, in unclean water, you know, take a look at your water in your tap water that you're drinking. That's another great way that you can really heal your gut is by just getting a good source of water into your body. Since our body is what, 80 percent water. So you want to remove certain foods from your diet. And then secondly, something just popped them.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, it's about 55 to 65 percent water. So I just had to do that because you agreed with 80 percent did. But anyway, it's neither here nor there were over hub of this. We can agree to. We are at least half water. There you go. There you go. Okay, so then secondly, you want to replace your gut damaging foods with healthy foods that are going to be good for your gut, and so this is my expertise. I love, love, love talking about good, healthy, real food on my website is the Paleo Mama and my whole transformation into eating more natural and living more natural. Started with the food that we ate as a family, so some really great foods that you can start adding to your diet that are going to help repair your gut as you are removing those bad foods. Bone Broth, I can't speak enough.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good things about bone broth and if you can't make it, there's so many good sources in the store now to buy it. Even Walmart has great grassfed. Bone broth in the freezer section comes in a little bag, I don't know the brand of it, but even kettle and fire, it's another now that's a shelf stable ones. So when we were in our RV traveling in the United States for a year, that was what we used. If I didn't feel like stinking up the whole rv with a instant pot bone bra. So if you can't make it, there's so many great sources to buy it and what bone broth does, it's really high and Collagen and it's really high in amino acids and these are going to really help to repair the cells of your skin or your, you know, your interior lining inside your digestive system. Next is what other healing foods, honey, fermented vegetables, fermented foods.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just about the side, so isn't buying pickles from the aisle. Number five, okay. This is fermented foods. Have to be refrigerated so you can get these. I'm bobby's is a really great brand that you can get. Those are amazing pickles if you've never had them and they're sauerkraut is so good, but it's actually super easy to make fermented foods like sauerkraut and Kimchi, pickles and beat coboss. I'm all you really do is put your vegetables in a jar, top it with salt water and boom, and like three or four days. You have some delicious fermented vegetables, so very cheap to make if you can't buy it as well.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I could speak to the amount of good bacteria that's created, another really wonderful source is a even tempeh, tempeh can actually be fermented as well. It's something that the Japanese have been eating for hundreds of thousands of years and it's called nattokinase or Natto. And it's fantastic for appropriate gut health. And the reason why we want to eat fermented foods is yes, there are some supplements and we will talk about those here in a few that you can consider it to adding as well, but when you eat a food that has been fermented than what you're looking at, by the way, one just popped into my brain. Again, Kombucha, even if you want to actually, um, so anyway, when you eat fermented foods, what you're looking at as you're looking at not just possibly billions of successfully, wonderful, amazing, awesome, yummy bacteria, but you can be getting into the trillions at that point. And when you're actually getting yourself a really good version of those types of probiotics, those are going to absolutely stimulate the appropriate response. And we're going to really rev up your gut health.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. Um, so next is really just focusing in on your dairy. Now if you eat dairy, we always have encouraged people to choose raw dairy. Now it's kind of a, I don't think it's very controversial anymore, but 10 years ago when we started, you know, looking for raw milk, I would seriously be behind the parking lot of walmart and it's like doing drug deals, but now it's more accepted. It's more widely available and raw milk is amazing for your body and really just for your gut. It's loaded with vitamins and different kinds of fatty acids and probiotics, especially if it's cultured. Now you can go on real milk.com and see if there's a local source scenario, but just make sure it comes from a clean farm that uses great sanitary practices. You know, we have our own milk goats and we drink the milk from that and that's raw milk. So it's milk that has not been homogenized or pasteurized. And if all of you listening haven't ever heard the whole roll milk debate, I'm going to make it super short for you. Pasteurization was created back in the fifties or sixties because they. Even before that. What was it before that? It was just Louis Pasture. Yeah, it was around the forties or fifties was actually like early 19 hundreds. The reason why I say that,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no, the reason why I say that is because the pasteurization process was created to preserve\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the milk. The problem is though they wanted to get away with more unsanitary practices and farming, so they wanted more cows in one lot. They want it to be able to shove more antibiotics and food into them so that they would grow quicker, give more milk, blah blah blah, and in order to do that, they had to really make sure the milk was clean afterwards. I don't care about how they raised the animal before and during, but they wanted to make sure afterwards they gave them milk a nice, you know, pasteurization and then boom. It's completely safe\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you to get by by extremely heating it to where you know the correct temperatures. We to get into the procedure of how it's done, but essentially what that does, it knocks out both good and bad bacteria. So that's one negative and then it also messes up and denature proteins. When I say denature a protein guys, I'm talking about like when you put an egg inside of a pan and you cook it, the reason why the white, the yolk or excuse me, the white portion of the egg goes to from clear to white is because you're denaturing those proteins and so you're essentially doing the same exact thing when you pasteurize milk. And so a couple of things when it comes to milk, if I may, that I wanted to highlight was going to real [inaudible] dot com is a great place, but also make sure that you check with your state because there are different states that widely are okay with the sell of raw milk. And then there are some states that will do something called a cow share or a milkshake or a dairy share and so you can like go in with a couple of different families. But make sure you just check the legality according to your state,\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you can pretty much get it in any state. But if you are actively repairing your gut, we recommend that you use cultured dairy. Cultured Dairy is like yogurt and Kefir. It's loaded with probiotics and extremely gut healing. Um, and you can make these super easy yourself or you can buy them, um, from your local real milk.com farmer. Um, if your state does allow the sale of raw milk, you probably can find raw milk yogurt or Kefir in your grocery store, but you, if even across the board you can find cultured butter in most, any grocery store today. And that is another great cultured dairy product that you can, can\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you. I mean, look, we're only speaking about being proponents of milk because we drink it. Obviously if you have problems with lactose and stuff like that, there are still other really great ways that you can go ahead, incorporate these, uh, these, these foods that will absolutely work against any of the, a traumatic things away we may have created, you know, and causing our gut flora to be, you know, swung in a, in a negative way so we can absolutely do that as well.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So next we're going to talk with you guys about how to repair your gut with certain supplements.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, so when I think about supplements, there are a couple that really, really have come to mind that have absolutely done a great job in my particular health. And so, you know, I spoke with eating about eating. Those harms are, excuse me, those, um, those fermented foods. Right? And when we talk about fermented foods, we're still talking about it. These things are teeming with good bacteria. So starting off with a really good fermented food regimen, you know, I needed a couple of times a week, I'll add it to a salad, sometimes I'll just grabbed the pouch and I'll just take a scoop of it. And I'll eat one or two scoops of it right there on the spot as a quick snack. If fermented foods are something that you want to slowly introduce, but you want to do something positive for yourself, consider maybe starting some probiotics.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You want to be able to get something that's going to be an excess of about 50 billion colony forming units per day. The reason why we want to make sure that we use enough is because when we consider the harsh environment of the stomach, it's acidic in nature, and unfortunately some of those bacteria can be killed off by the hydrochloric acid that's in our bellies, so we ensure that we take a probiotic with a enteric coating, meaning that it can pass through the harsher stomach environment and make its way down into the gut where it's actually going to be able to grow and do some benefit\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for us. And when you're in repair mode, that's when you need that 50 to 100 billion units. But when you're in a maintenance mode, we really love the PB assist a probiotic from doterra because it's a lower colony, 6 billion units. It's lower and it's more of a maintenance, a probiotic that you can take and it's enter coated. If you've ever kind of cut your probiotic opened and looked at it, it has an inner capsule that's green, which is loaded with chlorophyll, so it's a very great, you know, maintenance probiotic that you can take, but when you're actively repairing your gut, you know, you might need to up it to a higher dose of a probiotic for one to two weeks.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, no, thank you for that clarification because yeah, we, I take that for granted because of course we're now at maintenance phase, right? It's if you're, if you're looking to do so,\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's is a really great time to take a higher dose probiotic\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because you need to re establish another way. This, this is the medical background in me. If you do have a need for antibiotics, let's say you do get an infection of some sort and you need to be treated with antibiotics. I absolutely recommend to you get on probiotics after your antibiotics are over because the antibiotics are going to go in there and they're going to take care of both good and bad bacteria. They're going to remove the bad bacteria that might be causing that infection, but then you need to repopulate with the good bacteria. So probiotics after antibiotics is also very much recommended. A digestive enzymes are crucial and I would offer to you that there's at least nine that I can think of that are essential to appropriate. You know, eating if you will, and I know that I don't get them all. I know that I don't get all of the ones that are going to break down all the different starches, all the different proteins, all the different milk sugars or other carbohydrate sources. I know that I'm not getting the ones that are breaking down gluten effectively. If I do happen to get some gluten in my diet, so essentially digestive enzymes can be there. He makes sure that their whole food based, that way they can be present in your gut to help create the breakdown of those foods in your guts or your body can actually absorb them more effectively.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So, um, there's a couple of really great herbs that you can take as well. And some of them actually, if you follow me on facebook or through my blog or newsletter, maybe frank can link that in the comments below in the description. But if you get on that, you'll see that I posted a mushroom hot chocolate recipe yesterday that is absolutely to die for. Um, you know, I've learned the medicinal benefits of mushrooms over the past few years since having our own farm. We find all different kinds of mushrooms, Reishi, what did we just find chicken of the woods, just lion's mane. So many great mushrooms. And so I created a recipe that uses mushrooms but also has an amazing herb called marshmallow now. Yes, marshmallow is the original marshmallow confectionary that was used before they turned to corn syrup. It is a very thick and lubricating herbs, so it's so good for your gut because what it does is it goes in and it literally coats your digestive system and starts to heal it.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it's, um, we call it a demulcent or Musa, Musa. It's, what's that word? Mucilaginous herb. It's very thick. It's a really hard herb to take on its own because it is like drinking a very thin snot. But what it does, it just is super lubricating. So if you add marshmallow root powder to your hot chocolate, not only does it, uh, it's great for your digestive system in your gut. It's going to code it, but it also gives it the really slight flavor of marshmallow. So it's a very healthy hot chocolate recipe that you, your kids can enjoy all winter long.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell you what, I love the fact that you became an herbalist. That's so wonderful. It's like you've just opened up our family to a bunch of really new and innovative ways to, to just, to be healthy because I'll tell you why. Like that's how it works guys. I mean, the only. Let me say this many times, but obviously we know that there are certain things that we should be doing that are good for our health, but if they don't taste good, we're not even gonna touch him, you know, I, it doesn't matter if you're young or old, we're not going to do it. And so I wanted to round this out really quick with talking about also, let's talk about mental health for a little bit, right it because I talked about how stress can wreak havoc in your system as well. And so we want to make sure that we actually consider different ways to help combat stress.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, getting a good workout regimen is going to be, it's going to be good, not like that. Just cause, you know, call it, call it the world is your gym. Get a good brisk walk in most days of the week. Play with your kids energetically, clean your home, you know, do things that are going to get you up, get you moving. And it will absolutely give you a, a renewed spirit. Uh, you know, doing some meditation, getting into scripture. I'm getting a massage. Spending time with loved ones instead of being on facebook are all really good ways of being able to do that. There are also essential oils that we can consider for helping with our stress, right? We can diffuse different ones like lemon, lemon is a lemon or other citrus oils is really great for combating stress and and changing your outlook and your aspect in life and so we want to do that very regularly. Okay. We also want to make sure that we're getting enough sleep, sleep, when we don't get it, it causes a multitude of different situations and none of which are going to be great and when we deal with a chronic, or excuse me, what I should say, like longstanding sleep issues, is that our body can heal itself and so we do all these really wonderful things, not sleeping well, really not doing anything for our body, so we need to make sure that we were getting seven to preferably eight hours of good, fun, amazing sleep every single evening.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a couple other oils that are really, really great for you as you're repairing your gut. I want to just stop talking about my favorite new one and that's fennel. Fennel, Wa is a very underused essential oil. Many of you probably haven't even purchased it yet, but I want to encourage you guys to do it because it is a amazing herb, an oil for helping with anything related to your bowels, into your digestive system. And in fact, um, I love this oil and herbs so much. Now we have a little bowl sitting on the kitchen counter with fennel seed and we frequently just nibble on it before or after our meals just because it helps just digest your food. Just really helps with any of that uncomfortable digestive issues that you could have before or after you eat your food. So I really want to encourage you guys to get some fennel, use it. You can actually apply it topically onto your belly and putting, you know, putting it in a roller bottle you can do for your kids. You can also put it in a diffuser if you've never tasted fennel, you're in for a treat because it is a very sweet oil. And in fact, if you want to come off sugar, you can sweeten your coffee or tea with the drop of phenol, but that's one of my favorite oils to use for anything related to the digestive system.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And then there's a couple of others that come to mind. Um, coriander is one of them. Cardamom, lot of folks use cardamom for respiratory health, but you can actually use it for gut health as well. It is a phenomenal for being able to help with the feelings of indigestion and bloating and you know, the occasional cramps that you might feel and stuff like that. Especially if you've overindulged, which is really a good pro tip for this coming holiday season.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that [inaudible] does is it helps to balance your stomach acid and the juices in your gastric system. And so that's why, you know, it's added to tease and it's added to even chai tea. It's one of our favorite ones. We love putting cardamom minute, but it really helps to balance if you have issues with your stomach acid before you or after you eat something, take a little cardamom and put a drop in your tea and it's really gonna help regulate those gastric acids that can\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come up and and and I love, like I said, putting laminate diffusers really great, but lemon is very cleansing. It's really great for liver health as well as gut health. It actually will help cleanse the mucous membranes down inside of your gut as well, allowing it to respond and, and function the way that it's supposed to and all these essential oils that we talked about. We actually could even consider using those in a blend called DigestZen, which is really nice because those wells to include peppermint, which Jackie's going to talk about in just one second, is a great way to compliment a, you to be able to have really great gut health.\\n\\nJackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, peppermint is my Swiss army oil. It's used for hundreds of different things, but um, the ways that I like to use peppermint, it's excellent for cravings. And so if you are on this journey of healing your gut and you've eliminated foods, you might crave some of those old foods that you used to eat. And so peppermint is excellent at helping manage those cravings. It's also so great for any kind of feelings of nauseousness. So, um, I get carsick take the peppermint oil with me and I always make sure to have it on hand because it really does an excellent job at just, um, helping me not to feel that that way you can apply this oil topically, you can take it internally if you're using therapeutic grade oils like doterra and, um, it's an excellent Swiss army oil that you just definitely want to have around your home.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. Awesome. So thank you so much for sharing with me today, Jackie. That was just really so good. Um, uh, you have taught me so much about gut health and that's the reason why I consider it.

It's time to put you in the driver's seat to be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey guys, I'm so excited to bring you part two of my conversation with Dr Edwin Mcdonald of the University of Chicago. You can check out Dr Mcdonald on thedocskitchen.com as well. So enjoy the rest of my conversation today with Dr Mcdonald.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I, I hate to say everyone wants to talk about willpower and self control. Like I, I feel like these concepts are unsteady to some degree because it's hard out here and there are certain environments where it's actually harder. Uh, so, you know, imagine that being an alcoholic and your neighborhood is as far as the bar bar Bar, that's not a good environment for you to be. And uh, you know, regardless of how much willpower you have for the average person that is just, it's a setup for a struggle, uh, and not many people get through that struggle. Uh, and, and that's what our neighborhoods like. And, and, and another thing that really got me interested in nutrition, so I'm like, I know these nights from these days I live in these neighborhoods and you know, what I have seen over the past 20 years, the rise of dialysis centers and urban neighborhoods specifically here in Chicago.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when I look at a church, I'll see a church with a dialysis center next to, it was like a Popeye's chicken next to the dialysis center and me just looking at that, the image of like there was a dialysis center where there's a church and as a fried chicken place like, well what about this makes sense sense whatsoever. And, and, and, and for me originally I wasn't really interested in nutritional world. Like originally I wanted to be a basic science so I did research in the lab, you know, killing mice and trying to figure out how to, you know, great medications for inflammatory fat and stuff like that. But then when I started thinking about these images that just doesn't make sense. I'm like, man, I have a greater impact on people. So I just talked about food than you know, me being in the lab and you know, killing mice unfortunately because it was never going to be the guy that's going to cure a colon cancer. This is just not in the bed, is not a skill set and I'm okay with admitting that, but you know, I couldn't be the guy to tell people to eat less and there's something powerful in getting people to eat less referrals. It may even be more powerful then gearing going answer.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's the thing too is that like, you know, I'm gonna get into the next topic that I'd love to talk to you about. Of course with your conception of what you call The Docs Kitchen, but it's like. We cared. Look at reports were also kind of happening is that in America we're allowing others to cook for us these days. Now. Definitely growing up. I mean I'm Italian and in the heart of the home for most Americans was the kitchen. I mean that's where conversations happen. That's where like my mentors in my family gave me, during what my knowledge, that's where we sat around and just, you know, made pasta at that time and made these different types of foods that it would just create conversations. And uh, fortunately we have definitely moved away from the kitchen being the center of our home and now people who are even listening to this call and have absolutely no understanding of how to make food.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, you know, what, what is being delivered to them in these restaurants might be their only opportunity. And so I think that that fuels this whole food swamp idea is that even where I'm at, I'm in a little bit more of a rural area, but yeah, I can drive 10 minutes and there is literally fast food alley in one of the, um, one of the, the cities or towns should say one of the towns that close to me. So I really urge our listeners to try to just take a take charge, say to yourself, I don't want to do this anymore and I need to get back into the kitchen. Or I need to learn how to make food. We'll talk a little bit more about like regional/local food and how you can help support that as well. But let's really dive into, let's get our meat hooks into this whole concept of The Docs Kitchen. How long now has it been like, if you want to just kinda tell us about like, you know, this, this is spurring along that you needed to tell people about food and then how did you finally just put your foot through the door, if you will? And how was Docs Kitchen created?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, so I was looking through on the Internet for websites about nutrition. I felt one, there's too much information out there and information was all over the place. Uh, a lot of information. One, even though there were a few doctors who were actually writing about nutrition. Um, so it was hard for me to find any role models in terms of like actual physicians who are communicating about nutrition. I mean, there are definitely people out there, don't get me wrong, but it's just not a lot of us. Um, and then I, you know, saw a plethora of, you know, self proclaimed, nutritionists, Anaplan for a people that were there, were putting out, you know, there's some good information, there were some not so good information and what people should eat. And I felt like in order to combat that a, I need to create my own, my own platform.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So at first I was intimidated. I didn't know anything about starting a website. I didn't know anything about, you know, writing blog articles. This was uncharted territory for me and uh, and I'm a guy like was biology major. I'm with the medical, uh, getting on websites and whatnot. This is not what I did and you're still not my skill set and even writing and talking about it's just, you know, not my skill set and I'm a personality. So at, for many years after I went to culinary school, I just didn't know what to do. Like I had this training, I felt like I had the information, I didn't know how to get out there. And I, uh, asking friends, website healthy start and get started. But then everyone's just like, oh, it's so easy, you just go and work press, or you know, some people would want to charge, you know, give me $3,000 and I'll make it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm like, I don't have $3000, so, you know, one day I just sat down and uh, you know, just made it like I got on wordpress and I would mess with word press people to help people and they will give me certain tips and, you know, a month or two later there was the website. Um, so I started a website and I had no idea what I should put on a website. Um, you know, there's plenty of food blogs out there. So why would I just make a food blog when there's already, you know, thousands of food blogs. So gracious and, you know, people making good recipes. Initially I started just focusing on recipes, but then I just thought about it and like I'm not a good food. Photographers now learned through the photography. Um, so, you know, as I was building my skills as a food photographer, I'm like, well, I'm just going to write about nutrition, so I'll write an article about, you know, questions my patients asked me in clinic, um, you know, will, like, is coconut oil healthy or is, you know, should I drink Kombucha, um, or, you know, is it okay for diabetics eat fruit?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, so I would research the literature and, you know, answer those questions with the evidence base, not only evidence based but also experienced based. So then I started realize I'm like, you know, all these questions I have experienced in the clinic story, a personal experience, family experience, and then I have the evidence. I'm like, okay, well let's put it all together and make sure, you know, not only an entertaining blog post, but educational blog posts. And then when I started thinking about recipes, uh, I thought about all these blogs, blogs, or they have these great recipes, but no one really explained why, you know, food is good recipe. So I'm like, okay, well maybe if I give recipes, let me give citations and references as to why I put together this recipe of so now it becomes evidence based eating as opposed to just the recipe, you know, people learn something and you know, learn how to cook, but then also people learn the science behind some of this stuff.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I started doing it maybe about a year ago and uh, you know, it's still in its infancy, uh, but you know, people seem to like it and I get a decent amount of view that it's growing and I'm working on trying to figure out some of this Google Seo, search engine optimization stuff. So, you know, when people search certain terms, my website will pop up and uh, it is a work in progress, a blood. I'm committed to it and I'm trying to figure out ways to get better at it. Um, so, you know, the website is www dot [inaudible] dot com. Um, but what I found is that I use it as a resource and clinic. Um, so a lot of times in my weight management clinic also have weight management clinic. Uh, I'll sit down and I'll start talking to people when people say things like, Oh, you know, I'm addicted pails potato chips.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm like, Oh, you know what? I wrote a article about potato chip addiction and some of the science behind it. And as a matter of fact, let's pull up my article and in our clinic visit I go through the article and, you know, that it, it's an example. It's just like bringing up a powerpoint is that we're in a clinic visit. Um, so people really appreciate it. And then one of my patients end up following the website and neat and some the articles and asking questions, uh, which for me, I'm just a good example of how the Internet can change a clinic visit and you know, the way we deliver care. And I'm still trying to figure out like how to use this as a resource because it's just not a lot of examples. I mean, I just don't have any other physician I can go to like, oh man, so what do you do with your website and your clinic visit?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, so in many ways I'm just kind of on my own and trying to figure out how to use this as a resource. Um, and that's one reason why I like that healthy practice conference because it got me in contact with some of the few individuals in the country who are doing some of that stuff. Um, so there was the one doctor visit a young project and she was talking about how she used her website in the clinic visit and I'm like, oh, this is amazing. This is exactly what I'm trying to do. Um, and you know, another issue with the website, that's how they found me for the conference. Someone just randomly go on Internet and it came across the website and they're like, oh, this good guy\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak at the conference. Um, well for the benefit of everybody that was at the conference, I'm glad that somebody google search to you because you definitely have a great story and we're so grateful to, you know, be able to, to, to listen to your story because it's inspiring that there are medical providers, medical doctors, and a doctor of osteopathic medicine and things like that, like people that we go and we see, you know, um, and it's just inspiring to see that people are finally starting to get hip to this. And the downside is, is that access to medical care, um, you know, that is another barrier in our country and it's very difficult for a lot of Americans to be able to see a medical providers at all. And so it's great to see folks like yourself putting out this information saying when they were still here because you still need these tests.\\n\\nSpeaker 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You still need labs. But when it comes to nutrition, you can make a choice and you absolutely can get started with something. And I love the fact that you also have seen on your blog that you also talk about ways to cook food. You know, like that's something that a lot of people once again have a problem with and so, um, there are, you know, what we in the military we call the field expedient lays to still create very nutritious meals and very short periods of time. It requires a little bit more of an input like, you know, like one of the things I remember doing when I was younger was um, I'd make all my protein for the week, you know, so I would, I would do something like that, but now we got like instant pots and you know, we can create a, I can cook a chicken and I think like 20 minutes, you know, whole chicken.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's inspiring to absolutely see that you're actually doing this work. And so I wanted to, like, if we could, can we dig a little bit into uh, this, this understanding of where, you know, preventable disease, like what I talked about earlier with the whole 80 percent of Americans can do that. What can we say to other physicians that might be listening to this podcast about inspiring them to also maybe consider doing the same? Because all over the country that data is showing it, you know, the American College of Preventive Medicine is showing a lot of really great data and research into backing the importance of nutrition and considerations for exercise or functional movement in their clinics. What would you say to those physicians out there who might be listening to this podcast? Like what, what can they do? What are some of these steps that they can take that you've already shown your intrepid endeavors, if you will? Yeah. So the first step is really recognizing the severity of the problem. Uh, so, and that's really, that really entails getting into some other nutritional literature and understanding epidemiologists and that public health isn't really taught well in medical school, medical school, learn physiology,\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pathophysiology, anatomy of a lot of science, but it's not necessarily public health focus and sometimes it is, but most of the times it's not a. So physicians really have to gain a true appreciation for the scope of the problem. So just a couple of facts. Uh, according to the CDC, a 650,000 people die every year from diet related diseases. Um, and, and that number should not be ignored. Um, also in terms of, uh, uh, data from a n, Hanes, one of our biggest kind of, you know, survey cohorts, cohort studies, they found that for the average American, 60 percent of our calories come from ultra process. So culture processes, they're like, I mean, they're like superhero of processed foods. Um, you know, we talk about processes, I'm talking about ultraprocessed foods and the next step up and 60 percent of our calories, those process, uh, and ultra processed aren't even real foods, you know, they really contained industrial ingredients that you can't find at a supermarket or in your kitchen cabinet or your cupboard.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, but that's where all our calories are coming from. Uh, and, and that has a huge impact on our overall health and the health of the country. Uh, so a physician as a physician, we have to recognize that problem, um, in the contribution of the way we're eating to health outcomes. So that's the first step. The second step is now figuring out, you know, what to do about it and how to get some training. So for me, some of that training did not happen in, in medical school. Um, and you know, I'm not saying that every physician needs the cloud and go to culinary school. Uh, I, I was lucky to have the opportunity, but you don't have to do that. Uh, so they are simple things that you can do. One Cornell has a good plant base, a program where you can get a certificate and plant based nutrition online just through Cornell and cornell is a legitimate university.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and I think that program, and it's not free, I don't remember exactly how much it costs, but I think it was like a thousand dollars. So, uh, but you know, for a physician, uh, being willing to spend a thousand dollars to actually help your patients. So I think that is a small price to pay for the benefit that you may be able to give to others. Um, and then there's also a course, there's an online cooking school, called Rouxby and Rouxby r o u x by, so roux, like a Gumbo roux. And, uh, they have a good course and plant based cooking, a certificate program and plant based cooking, which I also took. So even though I went to culinary school, I took a separate online course, uh, specifically focused on just cooking because, you know, my top 10 cook elementary school, they didn't really teach us how to make Tofu and tempeh and all this Vegan dishes and whatnot.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just, you know, they teach, you know, French culinary, basic techniques. Uh, so I had to seek more education in order to get good at some of that stuff and even learn about it. Um, so those resources are easy and you can do it in the comfort of your own home. Um, and then there's plenty of organizations where you can learn more about how to actually talk to patients about food. Uh, so if you're interested in helping people weight issues, you can join, there'll be deciding and go to obesity week. Matter of obesity week is coming up in Nashville, uh, I think second week of November, a great resources for folks who want to get certified in obesity medicine. Uh, and then there's a lot of resources, uh, the plant tuition project. Um, so, uh, Scott stull a plant based plant based physician has a website called I think plantrition.org, uh, and they have a lot of conferences so they have a plant based nutrition conference that happens, uh, in San Diego every year in September.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, great resource and, you know, a lot of physicians go there, but a lot enough physicians go there. Uh, so it's a lot of health practitioners, PA's, I mean, that's something that you may want to be interested in checking out. So, um, so I have lots of those conferences and, and got connected with a, you know, a likeminded people all over the country and, and just getting connected with likeminded people. To me it's, it's very inspiring and motivating, uh, because focusing on nutrition as a physician, uh, especially when position and when physicians historically have not necessarily focused on nutrition as much. Um, it, it, it can, some people look at you like you're crazy to, to be honest with you. Um, and seeing other people doing the same things have really just said like, you know, I'm not crazy. This nutrition stuff is important. Um, I remember when I was a resident and I was telling some elemental or is that I didn't want to do basic science research as much as I want to, you know, do a fellowship in nutrition.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking about going to culinary school. They literally said I was crazy and I was going to throw away my uncle Leo and uh, uh, wasn't, you know, going to be effective as a physician. Um, and that was the response and you know, I could have, could have ran with it and said, well, you know, let me just go back to the lab and, you know, and, and people know, there's definitely roles for people in the lab. I don't want to downplay any of the basic science researchers because we either that, but just like we need people doing research, we also need people talking about nutrition and actually implementing that. We are actually researching. Um, so, you know, you mentioned you being Italian. Uh, what is the most popular guy right now when it comes to improving health outcomes and that's the Mediterranean diet.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are research and researchers are researching the Mediterranean Diet actively common up a fault these benefits. So if you like wine, that's why the Mediterranean diet is nice. Oh, right. I mean there's a number of uh, one of the Mediterranean diet is nice, but now we just have to figure out how to get people to adopt the Mediterranean diet and that's where people like me come in and, and, and you know, also have a research background. So I've worked with some of the food scientists. I actually just published a chapter in the textbook food scientist on how to study and you know, the background information for it. Um, so I wanted those food scientists, but you know, ultimately if the science is, stays in the lab, doesn't help anybody. So we have to get designed outside of the lab to the actual people and the Mediterranean Diet. You know, it's funny that like if something new, uh, and it's not that you're like a Thai Italian grandmothers have known this presenter.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yup. Absolutely. Then all of a sudden, the past 10 years, it's just like, oh, we need for anybody listening on the call for anybody listening or call a promise Pasta and pizza is not the, you know, foundational staple and in Italians diet. I promise you this, it is not, that is the tip of the iceberg. It's the icing on the cake and we enjoy eating it on Sunday, but the rest of the time it's exactly what the Mediterranean diet describes. But, but also, you know, another interesting fact about the Mediterranean diet and it, it, it really is a testament to the, the influence of our western American Diet. So what country has the highest rates amongst the highest rates of childhood obesity in the world and it's not the law in the United States and the countries actually greet on the Mediterranean. Interesting, interesting.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, uh, well, uh, a lot of people in Greece and a lot of other countries are abandoning, abandoning the traditional way of eating. And you know, switching over to the western diet. You go to Dubai or some of these foreign countries in the Middle East, like Dubai in particular is like KFC, Wendy's, and Mcdonald's, and it's very much americanized. But when people grew up on this, you know, Middle East and bad, which is, you know, not too far removed from the Mediterranean Diet. It's like everyone's abandoned. He messed up and they're going down the route of fast and, and, you know, the stuff that, that's delicious, don't get me wrong, it's delicious, but it is doing it frequently. It's just not healthy. And the United States, we've proven that. But that is the way the world, the whole that shifting away from the stuff that, you know, to plc, it was going towards the fast food convenience. Uh, you know, if anything, stuff that promotes food addiction, um, and, and that's a problem\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a know because I'm not going to sit here and I'm not gonna pretend like I've not eaten fast food in my life. I don't think the American are really not touched them. But I would offer to you that I've gotten smarter throughout the years, of course. And when I eat a fast food meal, I actually am pretty hungry within about 30 minutes of finishing it. I don't feel like I've gotten satisfied from a fast food meal. I feel like I'm like ready to consume some more. And I think it's because of all that wonderful ultra processed foods that you were talking about earlier. You know, there's talk full of like super sugars and things that make me want to crave more food. I can eat salads now, you know, and I can eat berries and nuts and fruits and things like that. And I'll tell you what, I have felt more full and satisfied eating a simple salad for a longer period of time than I would if I was to go in and say by like I guess a big Mac or whatever. I just feel so much hungrier after I eat that food and being satisfied.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's really because the salad has a lot of fiber and fiber. It actually slipped when it combines with water. It swells and so it kind of increased in size and takes up more space in the stomach which can make you feel more full. Um, and\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff like that, getting more satisfied because I remember seeing a study that showed that, and correct me if I'm wrong, please, but um, you know, that that fast food, it can become synthesized so quickly in the human body that it actually doesn't make it down to the terminal ilium and where the terminal ilium releases the, the I'm not hungry anymore. Unsatisfied hormone back to the brain that say, Hey, you know what? I'm actually good still. I don't need more calories. I'm fine. You know. So I, I, I, I, just. The value of fiber alone. Yeah, exactly. It's incredible. You know, it's, it's very valuable because it actually will make its way through the entire system. And on top of that, we all know that the benefits of fiber art clinically for cholesterol, it's shown to just improve your bowel movements, which is super important. Like if you're not going to the bathroom every single day, that might necessarily be normal for you, but if you increased fiber, we're going to increase the ability for the stuff that's already kind of in there to make a way out.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, there's a lot of, like, there's a lot of stuff that can sit around and cause a bunch of inflammation in your gut. And yeah, we can have a whole nother podcast about gut health, but we have a podcast about gut health, but a take home point, people need fiber and fiber comes from food. So I'm not talking about, you know, these fiber supplements and get your fiber from foods that has fiber. And you also brought up a good point in terms of not necessarily having to have bowel movement every day. That is true. Uh, so average American according to a large study, large population study. I tried to identify like what is normal frequency for bowel movements where there's a range and that range. So it's basically either three bowel movements per day down to three bowel movements per week. So if you are having more than three bowel movements per day, that's probably not normal.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's outside of the normal range. That does not necessarily mean you have a problem. It just means you're outside of normal range. So you mean anything. And if you're having less than two bowel movements per week, you know, that just means you're outside of that normal range. So That's interesting to say that you're abnormal. Yeah. Just to say that you should be healthy like you shouldn't be. Like one thing I do know about is like stool habits, right? So like if you're like, if your habits dueling where you have to like physically use your abdomen to try and keep this stool into the toilet, that's the lead to a multitude of problems. That's a marker of compensation at the end. And then there's plenty of things we can do for constipation that's including changing your diet. Well, I wanted to round out, this has been such a great call.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder to round it out with just a concept that, you know, maybe I'm going to pull in my, um, you know, my agricultural education degree. If I may for just a little bit in the fact that we have a farm in the western side of North Carolina, we would love to grow our own food and I love that by the way, like I, I actually, I'm so jealous and I wish I can learn how to become a farmer. Just like you've told me that if you want to have me up in Chicago and you're showing me all the sights and everything like that, it stays the same for western North Carolina. We Love Asheville and you're very welcome to come on down and come visit the farm will show you what we do to a. I also have a youtube channel. I'm just going to do a shameless plug here, but I have a youtube channel.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can go check it out, not for just yourself. Dr Mcdonald Book. For our listeners, you know, you guys can check out like all the things that we do on the farm with the animals and we talked chickens. We talked to all that kind of stuff, but I say all that because it's a segue into this understanding of local regional food and, uh, and we don't need to have this concept of I can't get myself fresh fruit. I mean, please let me know about your experience. Is there a way that a person in Chicago, so we're thinking of major urban area here, can they still\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in fact put their hand on a farmer's market? Is that possible? Oh, definitely. Uh, so there are plenty of farmers markets throughout the city and even in these neighborhoods that our so called food deserts. Uh, so, uh, I think of the 61st street farmer's market, uh, that's the first thing that comes to mind. And the people who were on the 61st street farmer's market here in Chicago, which has the neighborhood in south side, uh, they actually sponsored all the legislation and ticket, uh, uh, food stamps covered at, at farmer's markets. So for people who do have food insecurity, who do, depending on snap food stamps, food stamps are available. You can use them at farmer's markets. And not only that, there's a program that matches, uh, uh, it's like a matching program, so whatever money people spend on food stamps a, there's a separate funding program that's going to match the funds so that people can actually get more food when they come in with food stamps and then otherwise, um, so that's one option.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, looking for the farmers markets, there is a new bill that's really encouraging a lot of convenience stores that have healthy fresh fruit. So there's definitely ways to get a good fruits and vegetables in urban areas. And thankfully a urban farming, urban agriculture, uh, it's really starting to take off, uh, absolutely, uh, on multiple different levels. So just on a community level, there are plenty of community farms. Uh, I mean, uh, I live on the south, uh, and I have my little little garden in my backyard and, and it's not even a garden for a bunch of blocks. A backyard is actually concrete. Uh, so I have these little, I have maybe about eight or so or earth boxes and I, um, have all my herbs that, you know, Broccoli and tomatoes and all that stuff in the backyard, you know, that I, that I use and the inspiration for the earth locks a really came from the sheriff, Rick Bayless, Rick Bayless, Chicago Chef, a famous for Mexican food and on the rooftop of his restaurant, he has, you know, hundreds of Erp box and the vegetables that he serves in the restaurant comes from the vegetables on, on the rooftop of the restaurant.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm like, Oh man, if he can do that for a top class world class restaurant, I can do that for my family. Like a opposite, trying to feed, you know, for the people but not a whole restaurant work with people. So that's what I did. And uh, there's also community gardens. So a couple blocks from me. There's a community garden where everybody in the neighborhood plans and we've identified, you know, people, uh, in our kind of block club take care of in certain days. Uh, and, and that, that speaks to community. You know what I mean, that's like he was saying that should be doing\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so in terms of not only are we growing healthy food, what the garden is really a, a way to grow a healthy community. You're interacting with your neighbors. And I mean if anything, it's taken us back to, you know, uh, a, a time in the past where neighbors actually hung out and communicating. Um, so now we are in society. You absolutely right. So the foundation of America is agriculture. I mean we, uh, you know, when you, when you think about, I mean just for father's time, just to speak about how our society has evolved over the years is that we started off with people. Yes, they were bankers. There were lawyers, there were all those other types of things. But the fact of the matter was, is that every one of them to include George Washington himself actually at Mount Vernon that loves to retire, to the concept of this, this new coin term called Agra therapy guys.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been around forever. I mean, we know that putting your hands in soil is something that will root you and connect you to something bigger than you and you know, use the Internet for what it's worth, but use it for, you know, creating societies, reach out to your local areas, look for these things on facebook and like really get into it. And you don't have to be a farmer to start. I mean there's farmers of all levels here. There's, there's people who are doing it of all levels. If your thing is that you don't want to grow, you know, celery or something like that, maybe you're a fantastic farmer of flowers and you know, there's something about flowers, you know, so there's, there's, get out into your communities and in strive to do this. If there's nothing going on around you started, you know, like, like get up there, mess up because I'm gonna tell you right now like, yes, I'm a farmer, but the fact of the matter is that I will never.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still won't consider myself a good farmer, but I definitely would think that I have worked myself through messing up plenty of times to where I'm okay now, you know, so I had no farming experience. I wasn't born and raised in, you know, an agricultural society, if you will. I was, I was born in the city, you know, I was raised in the city and I made that choice to say I got to get out. It literally back to my roots. And so that's unfortunately what's been going on in America over the course of all of these years is that people have migrated toward urban areas. And so we, we really have lost our connection with food ever since World War II. We have never seen an influx toward urban areas as much as we are now. And so when I, when I throw out the term local regional food guys, I'm talking about like getting out, finding out who these people are, supporting your local farmers markets because you have a choice and you can put your food dollars back into your communities and that will help generate additional opportunities for these farmers that these growers to give you the food that you want.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to buy the food that has been given to you out of like your grocery store, you know, there's fine food there. But then I can uncover this whole thing about like, you know, yes, it's labeled organic so it must be good for me. Or the fact of the matter is, is, is organic food may not even be grown in the United States. It might be grown in a farm that's thousands of miles away. And so when you bring up Rick Bayless, I love that because to me I don't even have to know that the food is being grown on a rooftop or in somebody's backyard or you know, at the restaurant. I just tastes fresher. To me. Yeah, I can definitely experience a different taste, you know, flavor profile because at the end of the day, not only do we want the food to be nutrition, it's kind of tastes good, you know, so even if it doesn't taste good, we're not eating it, you know, so I'd be happy to have your omelets at Mcdonald's.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'll tell you that pretty good actually. Other things that you can do a, so a lot of places, I mean pick out with your local farms and, and the best way to do that, it's really just go to your local farmer's market. And when I go to the farmer's market, like I talked to the farmers and a lot of farmers, they have CSA boxes. Absolutely. You sign up for their CSA, you know, once a week you get a delivery of a bunch of different fresh fruits and vegetables, whatever. They have a. and it's the stuff that they pick it and send it to you. And it's not like it's sitting on a truck somewhere or sitting in a warehouse somewhere or he, a lot of food is a whole separate conversation. Uh, it's going straight from the farm and you get an idea of what food is supposed to look like.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 37:11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A so now not like every vegetable or fruit is this perfect specimen that ends up in the supermarket and that's okay. Like it doesn't have to look pretty, uh, just have to be good for you and be healthy and taste good. So look and taste, you know, somewhat they're connected but not always a race on everything we've been taught to some degree for the CSA boxes are definitely, uh, you know, one way to go for many people and if I can add to that tier, there's folks that are also doing meat CSA as well. So if you need protein in your life and you don't want to just have a plant based diet, which you know, you could sit there and we can talk about pros and cons of all of that anyway. But if you'd like fresh meats as well and make sure that they're grass fed, make sure that these animals aren't grain finished, you know it's going to just have a better, healthier nutritional profile for you if you follow those particular ways.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then it was just like the CSA box for produce. They now there's a lot of farmers getting pretty ingenious out there and they can actually have CSA boxes for meats as well. So you can have poultry and pork and beef and you know, other seasonal meets if you will, can all be in the same box as well. And really what you're doing when you, when you opt in for something like that for community agricultural programs like this is that you're, once again giving more food dollars to those local farmers so they can continue to support you in your demands of what you want for your. So you have a choice. You don't have to, you don't have to eat what's put in front of you. You can cause there to be better for. To be put in front of you. Yeah, definitely a whole wholeheartedly.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then plus it's just good support to farmers, especially the farmers who are outside of big agriculture. So at the whole the impact of big agriculture, that's a whole separate conversation. Oh yeah, totally, totally. So. Well, I mean, I'm like speechless because I'm just so giddy about like just all of the, all of the hopefully great content that we delivered today. I mean, I'm so thrilled and I'm so honored that you've joined me on this call today. I just, once again, I wanted to make sure that we let people know it's the thedocskitchen.com correct.

So please make sure that you go check out Dr Mcdonald on the docks kitchen and uh, and we will have a list of resources that you can also look at that we talked about on this podcast today.

So like she set out to say, you know, I want to see patients, this was gonna be my livelihood, but now she's a pediatrician practicing in Virginia and she does all of this like, you know, essentially for free, you know, like she provides this really great resource. She's going to change the name of it, but there's this resource and it's escaping my name, I think it's the machine, the machine or something like that. The eyes you can input, you can input what you want or excuse me, what you have inside your house and you can input these things and it will spit a recipe back out at you. And so you could say, like, I have ginger and I have an onion and I have, you know, maybe some leftover chicken or what have you.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you can have a stir fry dish recipe in minutes.

      "{'title': \"Episode #3: The Doc's Kitchen with Dr. Edwin McDonald\", 'description': \"Today, we get to discuss nutrition and its importance to health with Dr. Edwin McDonald, a gastroenterologist from the University of Chicago.\\n\\nHere are the notes from today's show:\\n\\nIntro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone and welcome to unconventional wellness radio, powerful and inspiring podcast Set to revolutionize and disrupt healthcare. It's time to put you in the driver's seat to be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone. This is Frank from unconventional wellness radio and I have the special pleasure and privilege of being able to bring in my new friend Dr Edwin Mcdonald on the call today. Dr Edwin Mcdonald is a board certified gastroenterologist who teaches at the University of Chicago and he of course also sees patients there and he is also the associate director of human nutrition at the University of Chicago. And I had the great pleasure of meeting Dr Mcdonald a very recently, a matter of fact here in the Asheville area at the Healthy Eating in Conference Practice, uh, which was held by an organization called Asap, which is a great organization. It's a nonprofit trying to bring about awareness of sustainable agriculture. And they had this conference where they had folks who are just getting started with their medical careers. And then folks like Dr. Mcdonald has been practicing for a while, but they're doing very innovative and very cool things with the attrition and the bringing in all of these other aspects of wellness. And so Dr Mcdonald was a pleasure to have you on the call today.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, what's up, frank? And I'm honored to be here. Really appreciate everything that she's doing. So, uh, thanks for having me on the show, man.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. So one of the things that captivated us was your story that you, you're just a natural storyteller and I really want to share you with everybody out there in the, uh, the unconventional wellness world about just how brilliant is the journey has been for you leading up to your eventual deciding to go to medical school, but you really have this really great history of culinary arts. If you don't mind, why don't you go ahead and just kind of tell us a bit of that story of how you got started with that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So, you know, it's really interesting story about how I got into medicine. So, um, you know, originally what inspired me to get into medicine. Thanks. And my great grandfather who had never met before because he passed away before I was born, like before I was born. So I'm actually at when Mcdonald was for a, so I'm the fourth generation of men in my family with that name. And my son is assist. Uh, but my great grandfather was a actually a physician. Um, so we hear these stories about like how amazing this guy was. Um, and I have his name, but I never met him. Um, so I've always felt like I was, you know, living in that shadow. So he, uh, he was born in like 1893 or something like that. And his father was actually born a slave. Uh, so was born like before slavery ended.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just a baby at that time. Um, but my great grandfather ended up going to medical school at northwestern, which I didn't really know until I was actually a medical student at northwestern. Like I thought he went to medical school somewhere else and I literally found out when I was a medical student, coincidentally at northwestern. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, my great grandfather, it's funny, he was a pediatrician here in Chicago, so, uh, at that time African Americans can only go to certain hospitals. Do you know the way the world was that time? Of course, the unfortunate. Yeah. But that's, I mean, that was the reality of it. So, uh, he was a pediatrician in the hospital that was the only house in Chicago that was the African American and uh, as a result, a lot of my patients who are like in their nineties now actually his patients.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that right? Yeah. You never even knew that you were going to follow in his footsteps. And we actually have the same patient to some degree, but I have at least at least maybe 15 patients that had my great grandfather as their. Yeah. So I got into a, that's how I originally got interested in the medicine and um, subsequently, uh, you know, went to medical school and all that good stuff. But I got into nutrition primarily. It really started when I was younger. I always enjoy cooking from my grandmothers, taught me how to cook and everything. Uh, when I was younger, my mom was off in the hospital frequently, so I had to be the person that cooked for the family. So, uh, one of my grandmothers and, you know, these are like matriarchs of the family, so they really sat me, gave me cookbooks, you know, I'm like 10 years old, flipping through July of cooking, trying to find recipes for the family.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, I loved it. So I ended up with a halfway decent cook. And in fast forward to my teenage years, I started working at Mcdonald's and actually became a manager at McDonald's. So when I was working there, uh, I will see these families who will come in to Mcdonald's every day for dinner or some people come in every morning for breakfast. And I, you know, I just thought something was odd about that. Um, I don't really have the medical terminology to express what I thought was odd about it, but something just didn't seem right about people going to Mcdonald's every single day all the time, you know. So I started cooking thing. So then that wasn't on the menu. So I'll make omelets in the morning like you can't get, you know, Mcdonald's, but I would take the, the Canadian Bacon from the egg mcmuffins and the onions from the big Mac, uh, and the eggs from the egg mcmuffins and, you know, put them all on the skillet and own the grill and make omlettes.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and it got to the point where my Mcdonald's had a secret many became the iron chef at Mcdonald's there just for one, you shouldn't have. I should've put a 16 year old and anything. This is true and that's what you get. You get secret menu at Mcdonald's on the 16 year old is running the show. Uh, but, you know, for whatever reason, people enjoyed it. And uh, you know, seeing the fact that people enjoy what I was doing, a really showed me how important cooking was outside of my own home. You know, cooking for your family is one thing. But then when you start cooking for other people and really seeing how the positive impact that can have on somebody outside of people who actually like or no, you, uh, it's good. Uh, and that's something that I carried with you throughout Undergrad and subsequently in medical school.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I got into medical school, uh, you started learning about disease. Um, you know, for the most part in Undergrad and high school, you don't really learn about it disease and like what goes wrong with the human body and why. Uh, so even though I had this premed curriculum that was all science class, it wasn't actually learning about what happens to people and why, why things happen to people. So medical school was my first exposure to some of those concepts. And I remember being in some of those lectures sitting in front of the class and lectures would say, you know, we'll have a talk on diabetes. And they're like, well, diabetes, most of the reason why people have diabetes type two diabetes United States is because of the foods that we, uh, high blood pressure people in the United States eat too much sodium a heart disease. People eat foods that are too high in cholesterol. So I wouldn't raise my hand after all those lecturers and ask the lecturer, uh, well, what should we be eating? And uh, there will be a blank face, a blank stare on their face and no one would have a response. They will just say, well, we need right.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one would actually define with eating right was, um, and I would sit in the front of the class and a lot of these conditions disproportionately affect African Americans. And for me as an African American, you know, I'm asking the question not only as a position but also for myself, like I don't want to get diabetes for sure. Sure. I don't want to have high blood pressure. Uh, so, you know, there was definitely a desire to help others. But there was also, you know, I'm asking the question, how is self preservation to some degree? And no one would give me an answer and that effect, people will get annoyed. Like, why are you asking this question? So, you know, medical school, it didn't really, it just said these were the problem, but we didn't really learn about solutions. I mean, we learned about pharmacology. What medications the kids for high blood pressure.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can tell you a dozen medications for high blood pressure, but your average Dr probably couldn't tell you a dozen foods that can help with high blood pressure. Um, so that's something that, that carry on that I took when I went to a, become a resident and as a resident when I started having my own clinic, I had a clinic at the Jesse Brown VA where I had the privilege of taking care of veterans and like I told you at the conference and everyone at the conference, I really appreciate it taking care of that. Uh, if I had to pick out the one and one of the most important parts of my training, uh, probably my exposure to the veterans and, you know, being able to provide care for them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an amazing experience to be able to hang out with the World War II veterans, Korean War veterans and a Vietnam veterans. Most of the patients at that time with Vietnam veteran. And then, uh, at that time, uh, some of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, you know, I saw the first wave of people coming back. So, you know, people were able to share the experiences without what you're actually talking to one of those on the podcasts right now.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I was, I was a Iraq war veteran, so it's so know for me, uh, I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for the veterans. And then I also really appreciated hearing their stories and perspective because you know, what we see on the news and what really goes down. These aren't necessarily one and the same and you don't really know that until you have the opportunity to talk to somebody about that. So for me, you know, it was humbling. Uh, but I learned a lot and I didn't want that. If it's one of those experiences that you really. Well first of all we say you,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a veteran. We love our physicians and so if I tell you we thank you for your service as well and that uh, and that there really is like just value in hanging out with the veteran community because there's just so many stories like we come from all corners of the United States and to be able to descend what that common thread of curving, you know, and then just the networking that goes along with that is just changing. So, and\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a side note for you listeners, if you guys have any politicians that threatened to take funding away from the Va hospital and does not want to give va hospital needs, like those politicians are terrible and you should not support them. Uh, and you know, you can quote me on that and calling you versus Chicago Hospital and tell them, I said Mcdonald, you have to add an a to z so you'll still be able to find it. But yeah, no, thank you for that. So I had one veteran in particular and he talked about his story at the conference. So I'm a young intern. I have my clinic and I came into medicine with a certain degree of idealism. I'm very idealistic and I want to be this great doctor and I really want to help people and I see this patient for the first time, uh, I look over his chair, get his history and I see all the notes from other doctors and he had all the common diseases that affect Americans.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, had a mild stroke in the past, you know, mild heart attack and the path also had fatty liver disease is probably 100, 150 pounds overweight. And he also recently got divorced because he had erectile dysfunction. Uh, so with all the stuff he had gone on as far as health issues that lead to erectile dysfunction, which led to the divorce. And then plus, you know, he had some depression and you know, a whole bunch of things going on. And I lived through his chart. Every time we will come to the doctor, his blood pressure would be a little bit elevated. And when my colleague, which is add on another blood pressure medication or increase the dose blood pressure medication, if he came in, let's see, it could be a little bit higher and you know, every person, all they would do with that, another medication on our increased insulin and insulin actually promotes weight gain. So as his insulin, uh, as, as, as insulin builds with increasing his weight was simultaneously increasing with it. Um, he would have a heart attack, you know, they just give them aspirin or you will go from a baby aspirin to a full dose aspirin. And I was the response to heart attack, uh, if I may\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the workers for the benefit of the listeners. Dr McDonald, I wanted to let you guys know where there's a, there's a description is that I'm, I'm a, I'm a physician assistant. I didn't necessarily say that, but you guys probably know that to me, my other podcast. But that's something that we call it polypharmacy. And there's a way that a lot of Americans these days are being managed is that it's like if one blood pressure medication isn't working, there is a complimentary blood, my blood pressure medication that has been created, different class of medication, but then you ended up running into patients that are on five, six, seven medication to handle all these conditions that Dr Mcdonald was talking about. And then you can run into a slew of possible side effects that may or may not be going on. You know, like one of the most typical side effects with somebody like in the veterans community, the antidepressants is going to be erectile dysfunction and you have to watch out for some of the medications that folks are on commonly because a lot of folks just will tack these medications on. They do a quick little scrub, but then they're on five or six medications, which I don't know if anybody really likes to do that. But that's the concept of polypharmacy if that's okay. Then I ended that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh definitely, definitely. And then for me as a physician, I don't want to downplay the need for medication because in many situations people need medications, medications, and well study to, you know, have some positive benefits for absolutely scenarios, but when you use medications without addressing the underlying problem, um, I think it's like know, I don't want to say the elephant in the room, but for lack of a better analogy, like we're ignoring the obvious in certain situations in his situation. No one address what he was eating. And for me I felt like it was, there was obviously an issue or obviously something that we should talk about. But when I looked through all the notes, I didn't see any comment on what he was eating. I didn't see any, uh, you know, dietician though switching, unfortunately America, it's actually hard to sit down with a dietician, a.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most insurance companies don't pay for dieticians and Medicare, Medicaid, you know, good luck. You have to have really bad diabetes to be able to sit down with a Dietitian or um, and, and even still, they may not cover everything. Uh, so it's just like, why do you have to wait till you have diabetes in order to see a dietician? Like we should see Dietitians so we won't get diabetes. Right. That's a whole separate conversation. So I sat down and I asked them a simple question. I'm like, hey man, you know, so I see you have all these diseases that done from diet, like, what are you eating? And you just told me how and you know, I didn't think he meant hot dogs for every meal. So I asked them, I'm like, well, what are you doing for breakfast? And you know, he calmly said hot dogs.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I'm like, well, what are you doing for lunch? And he seemed a little bit, a little bit more annoyed. I could hear it in his voice a little bit, a little bit of anger and he's just like hot dogs. And then I asked them again, I'm like, okay, well what are you, what are you doing for dinner now? At this point I could tell he was visibly annoyed. Like he stood up, he looked like he was gonna walk out and I'm just like, listen, work with me man. And then he said hot dog again. Um, and so I realized he was really just eating hot dogs every single meal. Uh, and, and these weren't even hot dogs with relish on it. It was no festival whatsoever. It was just the hot dog and he didn't put ketchup on it. It was hot dogs and mustard because in Chicago, you know, Chicago style dog typically does not have ketchup on it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So he was just more of a southern thing I suppose. Yeah. I, you know, I should look up the history of that. But, uh, nonetheless, he was just eating hot dogs with mustard and, and I, you know, I told them, I'm like, you can't live on hot dogs. That is, that is not a life promoting dies, if anything that is a death promoting died show. And I realized we had to make some changes. So I gave them a recipe, a nothing fancy at that point in my life. And I knew how to cook what I wasn't a trained chef or anything like that. So I gave them a recipe. I just said, look man, what vegetables do you like? And he was just like, well, I love Broccoli, I love cauliflower. And I'm like, okay, cool. We can work with Broccoli. Um, I told him to basically just put some grass on cauliflower and Broccoli.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some olive oil on it, a little bit of salt, not too much because you have high blood pressure, a roasted and up and put it in for 25 roasted for 15, 20 minutes, get a little bit drawn and not too much. It'll come out the list. And he said, okay. I wrote down the recipe, we shook hands and I thought I'd come back and see me in three months. So three months later he comes back and I mean, he's like 40, 50 pounds down if he complained of dizziness because blood sugar was going low periodically. And also his blood pressure, uh, was a lot lower than what it has been a. So I'm looking at this guy, you know, I think the guy had cancer or something. I'm like, man, we need to check your prostate, like what was going on, did you get colonoscopy because she lost all this weight and I'm and I'm like, what have you been eating?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he basically was like, well, I stopped eating the hotdogs and I just ate the roasted vegetables. I'm like, well what's your this? And he wrote us lunch and you got a little bit of Noi roasted vegetables, dinner, the same thing. So he essentially switched over to a plant based diet and found that his blood pressure was low. Again, the blood sugar is on the low side. So we had to slowly decreases insulin. We had to slowly decreases blood pressure medication and you know, being on just Broccoli and cauliflower alone, that's not the healthiest diet to be on. And the longterm of. So we had the, you know, add some more plant based sources of protein and things of that nature and other, you know, variety of different vegetables. But know nonetheless, he switched over to becoming a vegetarian. And, you know, one thing that stood out that stood out to me, he said, when he lost all that weight, uh, he noticed that he can like his buddies, uh, whereas before, when he had so much weight on him, he couldn't really do that anymore.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost more weight, even mentioned that he had an easier time tying his shoes and put on his socks on. Whereas before, you know, he couldn't really put his socks on easy. Like it was a struggle. Uh, he had to have, you know, different tools to help him get his socks on and just, you know, simple things like being able to wipe himself easily and put it in the socks on, was his motivation to take things a step further. So, you know, he started riding his bike, he started, um, you know, walking more and started engaging in more physical activity. And, you know, subsequently as a result, he started feeling better. His depression got a little bit better. Uh, his erectile dysfunction got better. He started dating and you know, what I took away from that story was this was just all food, uh, this had nothing to do with me as a physician, you know, that there was no, uh, you know, it wasn't like a, I was, you know, the coaches it notre dam or something.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving them a great speech that inspired him. It wasn't like that. It was just, he just changed his diet and if anything he inspired me, uh, to, to talk about this with more patients because the change I saw him, I'm like, you know, can we replicate this? Can other people do what he did? Uh, and I found that yes, people can and people want to, um, we just have to give people the right guy to do that. Um, so that's why I decided eventually to after residency, a study nutrition and got to color in your school and get certified as a chef. So when I was doing my fellowship and nutrition at the newer Chicago, uh, that fellowship was mostly here towards clinical nutrition, which is very different than just talking about food. So clinical nutrition is really a, using a tpn and ivy nutrition, uh, and you know, placing feeding tubes and people's stomachs and stuff like that and feeding them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's really a sick population of patients. So these are people who've had severe injuries, uh, you know, be from trauma or car crashes and you know, a lot of their bowel has been removed so they can't include the regular way, uh, or people who have cancer and the cancer is blocking her bowels and we have to figure out ways to is to give them so they can survive, you know, as they're finishing chemotherapy. So a really sick population of patients. Uh, but then at fellowship wasn't teaching me about, you know, how to feed people who have diabetes. It wasn't talking about like everyday stuff. Uh, so that's, that's why I went to culinary arts school and in the evening and got trained as a chef and a, culinary arts training. Uh, you had to actually take a nutrition class. And the crazy thing is, you know, throughout medical school, I didn't have a nutrition class. I had to go to culinary arts school to get my first class and nutrition. Wow. And I went to a top notch medical school. I mean like one of the best in the country.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's crazy. But that, that's like the state of healthcare nowadays. And that also explains why, you know, we spend all this money on healthcare. We're the number one in the world when it comes to health spending. But in terms of, you know, our actual longevity, I think the United States where it's like 31st 33 in the world as far as how long were you actually living was there's a huge disconnect. Like we spend all this money but we don't necessarily get the outcome that we're paying for. So a lot of it has to do with we're, we're missing the simple stuff. And the simple stuff is important. So yes, you know, you can get the craziest complex surgery here. Uh, you can come see me for colonoscopies and I can take out polyps and possibly move cancers and you know, all these problems. But when it comes to, you know, the foundation for preventing some of these problems, uh, I think there's a lot of room for improvement in that space and you know, doctors play a role, uh, but there's a lot of stuff that can be done outside of the hospital and you know, the kitchen is just as important.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the kitchen is probably as important as the medicine cabinet.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, I just thank you so much for sharing that by the way. Ours is my, my second time, maybe third time hearing that story and it just gets better every time I hear it. He was like, I just get some nuggets out of it. So thank you so much for sharing that Dr Mcdonald and I think I echo exactly what you're setting and uh, and what this entire, you know, what does the entire concept of unconventional one of us is really centered around is still the patient provider relationship. There's still massive value in that. And I think that we both can say that we appreciate the fact that we live in a society where we do have major advancements in medical care. I mean, people are getting cured from different types of cancers all the time, all around the world. I mean, we might be on the cost of actually understanding.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, we now live in a world where we can treat hepatitis C, where we never. We never thought about that when I was going through PA school or medical school. Yeah. That was it. We were talking about, you know, these folks possibly having to go on the liver transplant list, but now we have a medication that could do it. So amen to the, to the advancements that we have in our medical care. But yes, some of those statistics that came out of the same conference that we attended was a, you know, it's unbelievable how 80 percent of Americans have a preventable disease. We don't die from tuberculosis anymore in this country, you know? Yeah. We'll get cases of it and stuff like that. But other, by and far these things have been treated and we thankfully have a society free of them. Um, but of that 80 percent of American, um, you know, depending upon, I guess the, the source that you're looking at.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen it as high as $2,000,000,000,000 in American medical costs to actually manage those 80 percent of Americans who have a preventable disease and so there's got to be. There's a problem here and I think that the biggest disconnect starts with the choices that we as the patients are actually making and so we need to empower our physicians, I think to let them understand that we want this and we need this and that. I don't care to be seen by a doctor, you know, many times throughout my entire year, I would love to come in, shake a hand, maybe have to do my colonoscopy when I'm 50 and you know, everything looks good. Mr Ritz, take care. Of, you know, I would love to. We would love for it to be like that, but you're absolutely right. I think that we are really losing touch with food. It's becoming far too easy for us to look at a way\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying, I just need this food. Maybe it is fast. We have a very fast food mentality and I'm not talking about just fast as restaurants. I think I'm talking about. We have this mentality that whole foods has made a massive market for themselves and they're a multibillion dollar corporation on the sense that yes, they sell good food, but the thing is, is that they also, you know, the reason why they were able to get people into the door was that they were taking their good food and then we're making it fast. So you could walk up and say, I want this, I want this, I want this. They'll put it into a tray and then you're out the door. So at least we're eating healthy foods. But yes, it's still a fast food mentality. So let me think about whole foods. We act like wholesome is a brand new concept, but if you go back to the 19 seventies, you know, 50, 60 years, etc.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every grocery store will hold on it. It, you know, there wasn't a whoLe, like most of the vegetables organic. Uh, if you went to the deli section, do you had, you know, people who really worked at a deli section mate fluid in the deli section. Um, so if anything, wholefoods is just returning to, you know, simpler day what we just focused on absolute. Well. And then one of the other talks that I remember that you had during your discussion with us at the conference was a, you know, these food swamps, food deserts, you know, and so if you wouldn't mind, could you describe a little bit about the food swamps in food desert concept for whiskers? Yeah. So, you know, food deserts, it's a term that really became popular and then they 2000 and it really describes neighborhoods where there is a lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, grocery stories that contain, you know, fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these neIghborhoods have convenience stores but not necessarily full fledged grocery stores. Uh, so those are basically call it food deserts. And the term actually originated in scotland and originate and United States. United states kind of took it and ran with it. Um, so chicago, a city in which I live in a definitely have some food deserts and most of the food desert is actually, uh, an african american neighborhood. It's not all of them are african american neighborhood. Okay. Uh, so food deserts do not affect everyone equally. However, allow retail areas, which they don't really get as much attention as he deserved. A, are also qualified as food deserts for different reasons. And so even though real areas may have farms and stuff like that, but, um, the fruit growing on those farms may not actually get to the residents of those areas and many places.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those area technically can, are considered food deserts, a food swamps, a little bit different concept. If anything, it's more of a realistic concept because one, if you go to any urban community has designated a food desert. It's not like you won't see food. Uh, there's plenty of food joints and you know, a plenty convenience stores. Uh, and so in many ways, those areas or swamp a swamp, unhealthy food and the food swamps, if anything, that's really driving a problem. Uh, you know, imagine if you're, if you don't have a whole lot of money, a hit, you're hungry. And when you're driving home from work or walking home from work or taking the train from home from work or just, you know, walking around the neighborhood in general and you pass, you know, your favorite barbecue spot or your favorite chicken joint or you know, mcdonald's or whatever, and you have to walk by all of these places. Uh, and these are places are the list of foods. It's not like the food taste better places and it's so easy and so tempting just to walk in there and get, you know, three wings for $2 or interference for us. And it's hard to, to be healthy in that scenario.

Intro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone and welcome to unconventional wellness radio is powerful and inspiring podcast, set to revolutionize and disrupt healthcare. It&#8217;s time to put you in the driver&#8217;s seat to be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you&#8217;ve always wanted. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone, hope you&#8217;re doing well today. I&#8217;ve got a pleasure of bringing my good friend Jen onto the show today. She and I have known each other now for coming up on five years. Yeah. And so we have, uh, met her through some various means. We actually have a history with jen when Jackie and I were separated, you know, retired from military service. We moved down to central Florida where Jackie was starting to dabble with Scobys and if you don&#8217;t know what a Scoby is, do we know the acronym? Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; symbiotic colony of bacteria and Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice, Nice.  Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was gonna back you up. Don&#8217;t worry. But essentially it&#8217;s the big snot thing that sits on the top of the brewed tea that eats up all of the sugar that you put inside of the tea that gives you that delicious fermented-ness. And so we met Jen through that and then subsequently when Jackie and I got started with some oils, uh, Jen and Jackie and actually reached out to one another and they were able to run with this wellness thing together now for the last five years. So a, jen brings a humongous, a vast knowledge of not only self research, if you will, of things that she has done for herself and the many members of her, her essential oil team. But really the biggest thing is, is that she has done a lot of like support for a lot of stay at home moms and she has a really great story that we want to talk to you guys about today in reference to her son. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, a lot of the research that she has done with some different supplementation and some different essential oils, if you will, in order to really be able to, um, I don&#8217;t want to steal her thunder but really help her son in a very, very vast and very, very exceptional way. And so what we&#8217;re going to talk about, Jenn, we&#8217;re going to talk about sort of like what led up to this sort of, the history, if you will, and then we&#8217;ll talk about like some various things that you&#8217;ve talked through with your practitioners and, and all that sort of thing. We&#8217;ll just kinda go from there. So if you wouldn&#8217;t mind, um, if you would like to, we can introduce your son. Uh, he&#8217;s not with us, but um, by all means, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s dive into this and let&#8217;s sort of unpackage what all has happened. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Totally. So I started looking towards living a healthier lifestyle during my pregnancy and I continued on before he was born and then during, during his baby years, and unfortunately the research that I was doing at the time was very mainstream and the research that I really needed to do was not. So we, I listened to my mainstream practitioner, he wasn&#8217;t fully vaccinated a on a slower schedule, but only because timing didn&#8217;t really work out. And then we made a cross country move and came back. So he was vaccinated slower than normal, but he was fully vaccinated. And then as he potty trained and got older, he never had a dry night at night. So I started, you know, fully potty trained by three sort, started doing all the normal things, cutting out fluids, cutting out sugar, you know, making sure he went to the bathroom multiple times a night. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started mentioning it to my pediatrician and his yearly well checks well by four, he had had chronic chronic ear infections. He was on 10 or 15, 18 antibiotics before he was to clear runny nose, green runny nose, ear infection, antibiotic. And we&#8217;d repeat that. So I started doing research on new pediatricians and I found a center in Orlando and it was founded by a woman named Cornelia Franz and it&#8217;s called the Franz Center in Orlando, Florida. And I went and I spoke with her and it was the most eye opening thing to have a physician who listened to me and who validated my concerns and looked at all of the little pieces of the puzzle and put them together. And so we got on a plan to really try and heal his god in his liver and just provide some really good detox measures for him. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may, I&#8217;m not to interrupt you because that&#8217;s already sounding amazing. A lot of folks who might be listening, unfortunately, there is a, a great consensus of all of us that probably have very similar stories where, uh, you know, I, I personally speaking in my own right, you know, as a, as a PA, uh, going through school and learning everything we learned about medicine, uh, it&#8217;s just so fast and furious and the knowledge is so vast that we end up missing a lot of the practicality of a lot of the information that we learned. And unfortunately we also end up not learning a lot of things when it comes to overall wellness. And so, um, I know that I might not be the only person that states it, but even as a parent, it&#8217;s very difficult to often find someone who will listen and be able to kind of understand that. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And because even harder to being a provider and a father at the same time because it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re problem solvers and so I still have that portion of my brain that says if you have this, these types of symptoms, it must be this diagnosis and this is the treatment plan that goes with this diagnosis. So it&#8217;s very cut and dry and uh, quite often providers have to actually be educated by their patients, especially these days when it comes to all of the different things that we want to do for wellness. So if you want to talk about that. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. So one of the key things that I found was um, you know, five years ago or so, mom sent me, I&#8217;m going to speak to moms, but there&#8217;s definitely dad&#8217;s included in that too, were discredited for doing their own research. Um, they were called Internet doctors and you know, mom, you know, mom, you know, just follow mommy bloggers and things like that. But women are really in moms and dads are really becoming more respected in the field of doing their own research. So you want to make sure that the articles that you&#8217;re reading in the articles that you&#8217;re looking up, look at who wrote them, look at their credentials, look at what scientific studies they&#8217;re linking, and if they just say, this is my testimony, that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to discredit it because there&#8217;s power in testimony, but you need to really just look at who your who you&#8217;re following, what their credentials are and what what you&#8217;re researching. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s really what I started to do. So I started looking at the difference in folic acid and folate and gluten and dairy versus raw dairy and really just kind of unpacking those things that he was eating and we were doing at our home. So I brought in essential oils, get rid of all of our synthetic cleaning products and sort of doing all of those things to really eliminate and reduce toxins. Swapped out our medicine cabinet for some natural things and some herbs and some homeopathics and some oils and different things to help support our bodies that way. Definitely cleaned up, our diets, started adding in some broth and some fermented foods and really just cooking more grass fed, organic produce, cleaning, even my organic produce, because organic doesn&#8217;t always mean grown without pesticides, it means grown with approved pesticides. So even cleaning that produce and baking soda and lemon oil and water and vinegar and just really drawing out as much toxic load is I could from his body is really kind of where I started with that. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, we started him on a supplement routine on a whole food, kids vitamin a on an Omega supplement and then on a kids probiotic and we didn&#8217;t really see much change so we continued on it. Um, but it really just kind of sat there for awhile. And of course I did all the normal stuff. I cut out fluids, I limited sugar, I cut out dyes, but we really weren&#8217;t seeing an improvement. So every year I&#8217;d mentioned it wasn&#8217;t really a concern. It&#8217;s still classified as normal up until, um, 13. So it was really one of those just we&#8217;ll wait and see kind of things. But the emotional toll that it took on him, on me, I mean we&#8217;re changing full bedding every night we ran, we did the bed alarms. I will come up every two hours for almost a year and he would still wake up less wet but wet. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was like having a newborn again. I mean, we were all just to the point of exhaustion when I, right before his 11 year checkup now, he had been wet every single night. We had never had one single dry night and we were standing in line at a theme park and I looked and I noticed that he was developing gray hair. He had two or three of them and I said, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a sign of a nutrient deficiency. I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of study in traditional Chinese medicine and that&#8217;s one of the, the signs that really stuck out to me in my studies was gray hair can be a sign of &#8220;B&#8221; deficiencies. So we went to his pediatrician, um, I had a list of blood tests that I wanted drawn to see if we could unpack this on a little bit deeper level and, Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and what I want to highlight what Jenn just said there is that it&#8217;s true, um, when it comes to, you know, you may bring a laundry list of lab tests and you might have to do some soul searching guys in some really kind of knocking on doors to find that practitioner that&#8217;s going to work with you because more often than not with the, with the way that healthcare is set up in America, it makes it difficult that providers may or may not actually be with you or order those particular tests because, um, you know, it becomes a, is this covered by insurance, is this medical necessity, things like that. And so, um, there might be some cost incurred on your end and it&#8217;s never necessarily the best of news to hear. But if you can find those practitioners that they do understand the medical necessity, then they will be happy to be really great patient advocates. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will go in there with the same mentality of the understanding of there might be something going on here that isn&#8217;t inundated in evidence based medicine currently, but it is definitely showing signs where you know, these sorts of things are kind of popping up over the country and, and people are looking into these things. I mean this is how we stay on the cutting edge of medicine is we hear often from parents, we hear often from patients about certain things that are going on. And then that&#8217;s when we started discovering new ways of being able to manage some of these more significant ailments that have been going on for years and years. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely. Absolutely. And when you find a practitioner who is willing to listen, typically they&#8217;re also willing to do their own research. So what I have found that when I go in and I say these are the things that I want drawn, what do you think? There are a whole lot more likely to do a little bit of research on their end than if I just go in fully at their disposal to get a full diagnosis from them as the same with supplementation. I go in with my list of these are the things I&#8217;m doing and even things like the common cold or flu go in there and say these are the things that I&#8217;m already doing. What can you add to that? So, and I feel like they&#8217;re much more receptive to that. So the first thing that I want to test it on him was, um, I Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted to know his mthfr genetic mutation status. I wanted to know if, um, if he was positive for that Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mthfr, we jokingly say that it is, it&#8217;s an acronym that could be, you know, taken in a very bad way. So I&#8217;ll let you guys come to that conclusion. But it really is that. And so a methylene, methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase is the very fancy a long organic nomenclature, if you will, for really it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a matter of making it codes for a particular enzyme that is responsible for sticking that methyl group on to something and one by. By doing that your body is either creating an active version or it&#8217;s actually what is called downregulating to become the inactive version and that&#8217;s how we do it as we&#8217;re calling it methylating is what happens that that it makes the gene either turn on or turn off essentially is what it does and there is a cycle of methylation that happens inside of the body and what we have found out, and like I said, this is tip of the iceberg stuff guys. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not something that is evidence based medicine. I haven&#8217;t seen a lot of like robust studies in reference to this yet, but there&#8217;s a lot of folks they say even upwards of 50 percent of the population may be inappropriately methylating. Meaning that it&#8217;s either happening in a far less right. It may not even be happening at all. Me and myself personally, I&#8217;ve had some genetic testing done and I have found out that I am below 30 percent, uh, with that particular enzyme and so therefore I have a difficult time overall and I also have prematurely grayed as well, but I&#8217;ve also had some other symptoms that have been related to what I feel is to be a bad gene or a bad set of genes for my Mthfr as well. And unfortunately we&#8217;ll get to the point, uh, in reference to what it may do for Kiddos. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But essentially we&#8217;re not advocating go out and go get your genes tested. By all means. It&#8217;s not necessary a buying far. It&#8217;s up to you if you wish to do it. I know that most of them, most of the time now it&#8217;s about $100 to do that type of testing. But then the downside is, is that, uh, with the regulations that are out there, you have to take additional steps to have somebody read that data because all you get is you get raw data and then you have to have somebody read that data and interpret it for you. And really, honestly, most of the time it&#8217;s okay to have this concept of ignorance is bliss and so if you actually feel that you might have a genetic thing going on because epigenetics, which is the study of things like this is epigenetics, is like our environment plays into our genes. So if you clean up the environment, uh, your genes in fact can actually be sort of cleaned up that way as well. And so anyway, we&#8217;re going to get into some of the weeds about that because if you feel so inclined to find out about your jeans and go down those pathways, then by all means do sell and then you get some really good data to be able to actually start making some positive change for you. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wellness. Absolutely. And well, blood testing doesn&#8217;t give you all of the information. It gives you a snapshot of where you are right now. Hair testing, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll pull out different things like metals and other things like that. But it&#8217;s, it was a good starting place for me. I wanted to know where he was. Now I&#8217;m just coming up on 12, uh 11. And um, he&#8217;d never really had any blood testing done, so I just kind of know what his labs were. Now we ended up pulling about 22 different lab tests on him. She pulled for lyme, Candida, a Igg, IGA, and igm. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So may I ask what was the Igg Iga and igm for? Was that like, were they doing allergy testing Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that, that was to tell what his candida numbers were showing how the Candida was affecting with the off gassing into the blood and how much of that was being. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, because when you&#8217;re talking about IGA, we&#8217;re talking about essentially how he memorized it as iga and IgE or sort of like your, your allergy markers if you will. The igg is like, are you currently having an infection? And then the igm is like how long has the infection been going on? So yeah, it&#8217;s really nice to look at immunoglobulins because that might give you some details as to. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the range for each, for each one of those, is there an n nine? And he was much greater than 10 for each. All three. And that&#8217;s what the reading came back. Yeah. So we pulled for that, um, we pulled his ADH to see how much um, antidiuretic hormone within, whether he was flipped and it turns out that he is actually flipped. So in the morning you usually wake up thirsty because your body&#8217;s like you need to drink all day and then when you&#8217;re closer to ignite, your body&#8217;s like, hey, we bought enough of this when he was actually flipped. So at night he was releasing all of his daytime fluid and then at night he would be thirsty in the morning. Good point. You know, he wouldn&#8217;t drink for the first six hours of the day, no matter how much we pushed, he wouldn&#8217;t. So his ADH was, it should be close to four point seven or higher. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was one point seven mm. What I asked her why, why that happened, she actually said that one of the few and only things that will throw off that ADH is mold toxicity. Interesting. Living in Florida, it is possible that at any point all the moisture would have been exposed to mold. Yup. So, um, so we worked on that. His vitamin D is supposed to be between 30 and 130 point three and his, my knees, which is supposed to be between four point two and six point eight was point five one, so super critically low. He almost essentially had no magnesium. It all on a system and my magnesium does a lot of things, but it&#8217;s vital for detox by the blood, which moves that Candida out, moves, regulates that Adh move that moves the mold and things like that. Um, it also drastically reduces the aluminum that he got through vaccines and through water or through air and things like that and instructs them out of the blood to the brain cells. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it also is a vital for the absorption of Vitamin D. Okay. So if you&#8217;re out in the sun, if you&#8217;re taking your supplementation, you&#8217;re getting in vitamin D, if you were magnesium is that low, then you&#8217;re not absorbing your d so you can be going out and getting it and still be taking more and more and more and still not be getting enough. So, um, we began, there were, there were some other tests that were normal and good and things, but we basically came to the conclusion that we really needed to do some heavy duty detox like on him. So I started with homeopathics silica, the six X, we gave two pellets a day, three times a day for three days a week for how long? An entire bottle. So at least maybe a month. So it was about nine to 11 weeks. More than. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Gotcha. Um, so two pellets, three times a day. Three days a week until that ran out. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re talking about probably at least two months, at least three months. Okay. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right. And the thing is we also do use, um, a large number of essential oils and with homeopathics essential oils will actually counteract the effects of homeopathy. So you have to be careful what oils you&#8217;re diffusing and what oils you&#8217;re putting on topically, especially when you&#8217;re doing that three times a day. Um, so I just, you know, to work it out to where he wasn&#8217;t exposed to oils before or after. We also started detox baths, so taking a bathtub, putting epsom salt in there, a half a cup, Quarter Cup/whole cup just kinda dump. Baking soda and then I used a Cilantro, essential oil and some whole fat milk kind of disperse that into the water and I&#8217;d make him sit at least 20 minutes. So he&#8217;s getting that magnesium insert and that a Cilantro essential oil helps to chelate metals and expert at the same time. So we did that, uh, just about daily for at least four or five, six times a week as often as we could. And I started doing the castor oil packs over the liver so you can get organic cold Pascoe, cold pressed Castro oil, put that on a washcloth, warmish and apply it over the liver. And there&#8217;s some oils that you can add into that, like juniper berry and Cilantro and lemon and things. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And would you recommend that we do that? Is that both on the front end? The back of the person or. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did it on the back of him because it was easier for me to get him to lay on his belly. And do it, but yeah, if you could, as an adult, um, for myself, I actually slathered myself in the Castro oil and then wrap an ace bandage and so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s Kinda how I do me. And they just keep it on as long as you can get them to stay still true. Um, you know, 20 minutes would be ideal. And so I started doing that on him again. We usually give him his bath, pull them out, do the pack. And it was a lot. It was definitely Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of effort in. I started him on vitamin D, um, droplets in addition to what he was getting from a supplement and we completely cut out folic acid completely, um, and increased the methylated fully that he was receiving. Sure. Um, and go and cut out processed sugar and processed foods, which is great for anybody no matter Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what you&#8217;re going. So if I could wrap up what jen is talking about, it may seem like this gigantic laundry list of things. And quite honestly it could be okay. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not, there&#8217;s not a magic bullet. Okay. Wellness and our lifestyle has to be something that we are willing to commit to. It&#8217;s not going to be something that is going to be that one and done and that is how more of a conventional medicine approaches that. Like if I have this particular diagnosis, then I can use this treatment plan and therefore I have a by and far when you look at it in terms of like black and white, that&#8217;s how everything is written. But really honestly we&#8217;re dynamic creatures. We require a lot more like input, if you will, to get the type of desired output that we&#8217;re looking for. And so, you know, this is just one pathway that jen decided to take, but remember this is not going to be easy. So you know, you might mean not dealing with a bad weather. You might be dealing with yourself, you might be doing something that, you know, you get into your own research and everything like that, but I guarantee you folks, you&#8217;re going to be doing something that&#8217;s going to require a lot more than just one step. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, yes. So from, so we started this. This is kind of our base protocol in addition to keeping them in on his Omega has broad spectrum kids, probiotic in his multivitamin. We added these things in and from November when we got the results and really started working diligently until May, we had four dry nights, which was huge. That&#8217;s a win, big win, huge win in that time. So I realized that something was working, but we needed to do more. So I added in Arborvitae essential oil and Cypress. And why? Why did you. Arborvitae has actually shown in multiple lab studies to kill Candida. Okay. So, um, we, we put that in, we apply to topically over the bladder and then Cypress essential oil helps to tighten those bladder muscles, get blood flow in and flush great vascular support. We&#8217;ll talk shows that may be sticking in the bladder. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I mixed those into a roller bottle for him. Um, I did about five drops of each and put those into a roller bottle with some fractionated coconut oil and had them apply those two, three, four, five, six times a day as often as he thought about it. Um, I noticed almost within a week that his sugar cravings had cut down. He didn&#8217;t want nearly as much honey. He didn&#8217;t want nearly as much other stuff. His brain fog cleared up very, very quickly, which showed me that the candida was starting to go away and regulate. We actually all have candida in our gut, but it&#8217;s when it overgrows that Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really has, it creates something that is called an opportunistic infection. And so candida guys, it&#8217;s floating around us at the time. It is definitely one of the most common yeasts that folks will come into contact with. But the thing is, is that when I say opportunistic, that means that if it gets into an environment where it&#8217;s not normally supposed to be there or the, say, intestinal flora, the other bacteria in use that is inside the gut, if it sees a way that it can actually grow and proliferate, meaning that it actually creates a lot of offspring. Then unfortunately that&#8217;s when we get set up for infection. So there&#8217;s not supposed to be as much yeast in that area as there is and it proliferates and it causes some symptoms. So, um, it happens quite often in our gut, very much so, Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very often in the gut. So we kept going. Um, I did change him from a child&#8217;s Omega and a probiotic and Multivitamin to an adult. Um, he&#8217;s 11, he grew almost four inches last year and so I feel like he&#8217;s transitioning into that needing more and based off of the labs that we pulled, he just, he needed more. So I made that transition and uh, we added in magnesium, so more magnesium and I found a four type a magnesium blend, 500 milligrams. And um, it helps with over 300 biochemical processes. So as low as his Mag was, we added that in, um, and just a huge, huge jumps in his vitamin D numbers very, very quickly. So, uh, I could tell that he was absorbing that well and that was working for him. Um, and then I listened to an amazing, amazing podcast by Dr Ben Lynch who wrote the book dirty jeans and he was talking about a specific strain of bacteria that helps you recover the gut from a antibiotic use, whether it was 40 years ago, whether it was recent and also really is designed to combat candida overgrowth. So I still gave him his broad spectrum probiotic in the morning, but I gave him, I started with one and worked up to, to have that short strain at night. Um, he said that it can cause, um, a lot of gas as that is. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s Boulardii B, b o u l a r d. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yes. Um, breaks that down S. Boulardi already. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as soon as the, uh, as, as the genus name guys. So it&#8217;s usually like, you know, there&#8217;s a genus name, if you will, by initial. And then the last name will be the species. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. Ask polardy. Um, and so we started them on one of those. And then too, because it can cost them flatulence and things like that. So you said it&#8217;s better to do it in your sleep, knock it out and get it over with. Sure. And then I started them on digestive enzymes because they really helped to break down the foods that you&#8217;re eating, especially if you&#8217;re not eating raw at every meal. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even if you are, I mean let&#8217;s face it, who really gets those enzymes so and always make sure that their whole food enzymes got to make sure that they&#8217;re whole Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; food enzymes and I would give him one with meals, but I would also give him one at night to help because if you don&#8217;t take it with a meal that it helps to eat up the rotten, rancid that&#8217;s been leftover. And then I also would give him one first thing in the morning when he woke up to cope, kickstart that metabolism and clean that stuff out before he ate. Um, and so a huge difference in that we also saw a huge reduction seasonal allergies. Um, when he started up in taking those digestive enzymes. And I started him on. We do one week on a month where I give him a, I&#8217;m a liver detox complex of whole food herbs, so it&#8217;s got um, psyllium husk. It&#8217;s got barberry, Kelp, milk thistle, red clover buds, burdock, and then some other things and I give him those two really help whole from the liver and detox. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And June we had about 12 to 15 dry nights. July we had closer to 20, 21 and for eight days and he was at summer camp and he was wet because he didn&#8217;t want to take supplements, but when he was home he was dry and I did a whole round of diatomaceous earth. You can, you can kind of look up different protocols and see what works for you and make sure you get food grade diatomaceous earth. And I sort of putting those in a capsule for him, pouring some pattern there now. So putting on, gave him two drops of Cilantro, essential oil a day internally, again, written by the my pediatrician, she was completely fine with the quality and the type that we were using just to pull more of that stuff out. Um, and so we went, we went through a round of that just to knock out parasites off the list to knock out any of any extra chemical exposure that he may have been exposed to. And fast forward, we really finished. We stopped adding things near the end of July and since I started school on August 11th. So by August 13th he has been dry and he has been dry every night since then. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s absolutely one that&#8217;s over one month overlap over one month that has such a high five for that. So, um, do you see this is a really, guys, this is how it can come down to. I mean, it&#8217;s such a, such a wonderful, amazing, powerful story that is, that, you know, you have, we&#8217;re in an age now that you have more technology or I should say you have more information at your fingertips than you could ever imagine. And so there is a really good appreciation of how medicine is starting to change and it started to become more patient. And so often, uh, you know, we, we do have to go in sort of not necessarily armed, but well-informed to speak with our providers who are absolute geniuses. I mean, by all means, this, this entire understanding is, like I said from, from day one, we want to really help you understand that the whole purpose of this radio podcast is that we want to create this east meets West Philosophy. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, well, I am so grateful once again, that we have such amazing medicine in our country, uh, but we can be doing those things every single day to make those steps necessary toward having this feeling of unconventional wellness. I, Jen was talking about getting appropriate sleep. How can we address that? How can we remove stress in her son&#8217;s life? How can we, uh, definitely the toxins by all means, we&#8217;re very much hit a diet, was absolutely looked at diet and nutrition. And then finally, I&#8217;m really just, the fact is, is that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re blessed because it was a child. Um, so therefore the activity levels, we have to look at things like that as well. Um, in order to be able to eat, burning off all of that energy as well. So by looking at all four of those different things are all those five different things we have been able to now or jen has been able to really create an environment in which we&#8217;re not getting the symptoms of such a detrimentally terrible thing anymore. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, really when it, when it comes to being with your physician, it is a partnership and I did my own research and winning and they&#8217;re well informed and was very open to their opinion. There were a few things that I had researched that I asked what she thought and she said, you know, I wouldn&#8217;t go that route. I go this route. I tried this instead, I&#8217;m vitamin D, You know, based off of the, uh, what his vitamins were telling me he was getting enough. And she said, well, sometimes sublingual usage is just more effective. So being able to have that open dialogue with your provider and it was not easier, easy to find a provider. Um, it was definitely an hour and 15 minute drive from my house. It was definitely one that, um, you know, there&#8217;s a wait, you can&#8217;t just get it all the time and, but it was worth it for me to find a provider that was willing to listen and create that partnership with me. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And, and, and I mean, if I can echo that entire understanding that it is a matter of is it worth it? Well, of course, because if we&#8217;re talking about a friend or a family member, I think that their health is crucial and I think that it is important than. So we may have to make sacrifices, but the, here&#8217;s the, here&#8217;s the best part is that once again to give you the hope of everything that you could consider, start doing in your own personal life, is that have the hope that one day you will reap the benefit of all of the hard work that you are investing. Jenn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. And um, one thing that I did forget to mention, we did go through multiple rounds of actual acupuncture and multiple rounds of Chiropractic care. And I do believe that those things also allowed those meridians and the those nerves to be truly in alignment to, to make this detox process work as effectively as it did. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely fantastic testimony.

It&#8217;s trying to put you in the driver&#8217;s seat and be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you&#8217;ve always wanted.  Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone, I am so excited to be able to bring this podcast to you. I am so thrilled that you&#8217;re here to join us today. I actually have the pleasure of my very first interview with somebody who is 100 percent amazing and has like just this unbelievable following online and she is just so inspirational to so many and on top of it all she&#8217;s my wife! And so like I get the opportunity to interview Jackie Ritz. She is the founder and CEO of thepaleomama.com, a blog website. And also I have been working with her on this journey for so long now that it just seems like she would be the perfect person that we should start with. So, I just without further ado, thank you so much for joining us on the show, Jackie. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thank you so much, frank. You got some Brownie points there to add to the, to the growing list, so I figured a good spot for us to start would be like, obviously we want to talk about our story because people that are listening to this podcast, they need to know like where we&#8217;re coming from. Speaker 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I just wanted to kind of like hit the rewind button, hit the retro button if I could and let&#8217;s go ahead and tell folks where we were in order to be able to help explain where we are now. Where do you want to start? Well, I think what it would make sense that we just go ahead and start with where I, where I was in military service. So as a young 20 something year old, 9/11 just happened and I figured I needed to do something with my life. And so I looked at everybody that was in my family and my family had all served in the military in some form or fashion. And I said, I don&#8217;t want to be the only person in my family that hasn&#8217;t served. And so like any, hopefully soon to be great American, I went into my recruiter office and I started talking to somebody from the army, well found out that I was grotesquely overweight because at that time I had lost my dad two months after nine slash 11 happened and just like anybody else, I drowned in my sorrows and too much food and excessive amounts of alcohol and so I needed to do something to lose the weight. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I got internally inspired. I was able to drop 50 pounds and I enlisted in the U, s army and I enlisted in the U, s army as a combat medic because I&#8217;ve always had a love for medicine. And so during my time in service I had the chance to work through being a combat medic. But then I became a maintenance officer and then I did this branch of the military that I had no idea what it was. But I said, you know what? This is the needs of the army thing. But then I had an opportunity to shadow a physician assistant while I was on my first deployment. And that revolutionized how I thought and what I wanted to do with the rest of my time in the military. And so I applied and was accepted to physician assistant school. I did it through the military and then I became a certified physician assistant at that same time though I was finishing up school. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s when I met my darling Jackie. And so she was able to stick with me for the last four months of my first year of physician assistant school. And then we both sort of like, just, we, we transferred over to me do my clinicals the second year. And uh, during that time we started trying to figure out what can we do to maintain our health in an appropriate way. Once I graduated from PA school, we subsequently moved to a station in Georgia where, uh, you know, now we&#8217;re going to start getting into sort of like where Jackie comes from and at that time really we, we had our daughter, we had our son. And then why don&#8217;t you go ahead and tell everybody a little bit about like at that point in our life what Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was happening. So, but at that point, frank was actually about to deploy again. Um, he had already been to Iraq for a year and, um, he had come back and they were about to deploy him again. And around that same time is when I lost my little sister. She was two and a half years younger than me. She made a completely impulsive decision and took her own life after she had lost her boyfriend the day before. And so she got so wrapped up in her grief that she just made a very, very dumb and silly decision. Um, and we, uh, entered a phase of fog, I call it, I don&#8217;t even remember a lot of the first year of my son&#8217;s life because we were in survival mode. You know, there was a very traumatic event that happened, you know, that I was a part of and unfortunately had to experience. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, and from that point on, we were, we were just in a state of fogginess, of survival, of grief. And we weren&#8217;t sure really how we were going to get out of it or if there was any kind of light. At the end of the tunnel, I had just started when my daughter was in my belly, I had just started come questioning everything that I was eating, putting on my body. I&#8217;d never really considered myself natural at all, never bought organic food that was for the hippies. And I became a Hippie, I guess you could say because I started questioning those things. I started looking at the ingredients. I knew it was going to, in fact my daughter and I know it would ultimately affect her growth inside my belly. So that was when I just started swapping things out, you know, I bought my first bottle of coconut oil. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember how awkward I felt like there were so many different kinds and how overwhelming it was. Um, you know, and then over the next year we just started slowly transitioning or other parts of our health, you know, our, our cleaning supplies, our medicine cabinet, a lot of that, you know, we started throwing some of the older stuff away and replacing it with elderberry syrup. Maybe some vitamin C or vitamin D instead of, you know, some other kinds of medications. Um, and then the sister thing happened and it completely blew us away. Somebody at that point, and this is kind of how the whole Paleo Mama blog started, was one of my friends, you know, how people like to feed you when you&#8217;re sad while somebody&#8217;s cooked me and fed me a paleo meal. And I remember asking them what that meant and, and I was thinking and the food was going to taste terrible because who wants to eat something that&#8217;s grain free and dairy free. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I remember taking the first bite and just like my eyeballs opened up wide, like the flavor was so amazing. And so that kind of was the pinnacle for us becoming a more Paleo ish family and we&#8217;re never 100 percent Paleo. We believe it&#8217;s more of a lifestyle to live by. Um, so we consider ourselves about 80 percent paleo. But that was how the blog happened, is I started using the blog as an outlet for my grief for some of the new recipes I was trying and making up in making. And even some of the new body butters that I was experiencing with, you know, I didn&#8217;t want to buy lotion anymore because of all the junk in the ingredients. So I started making some of those homemade recipes and created a really amazing following of readers on my blog who wanted to do the same thing and who also didn&#8217;t know how to take those, um, the jump into living more natural. And ultimately this is what caused me to write my first book everyday natural, which came out about a year ago was I didn&#8217;t want people to get overwhelmed with all the natural stuff and to get confused by should I just start in, swap everything all at once, you know. And so it&#8217;s really just a guidebook for taking baby steps into eating, into living, into having more natural children. And I&#8217;m just being a happier person and family because of that, because of their choices that you&#8217;re making at that level of your health. I really Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appreciate that. And uh, and, and I mean I can&#8217;t thank you enough because every single day we eat and have ways now that we just don&#8217;t think about that we know that we are positively influencing our lifestyle for the better. Um, I also come from a personal history of, and I&#8217;ll sort of parallel a little bit of what was going on with me and my professional career as well as my personal life is that, you know, I come from a family where my father passed away from a heart attack at 56 years old and 56. I mean like now that I&#8217;m almost about to turn 40, I&#8217;m like sitting there going, okay, now it&#8217;s time for me to go ahead and start really investing now more than ever into the lifestyle that I need. So I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve always wanted to follow in his footsteps. I just don&#8217;t want to follow in that footstep. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I was working as a certified PA and the reason why I say I was working as a certified pa because I&#8217;ve now had the pleasure of being able to work at home with this lovely lady for the last three years. And so, uh, when I was doing my professional career, I actually came across people who were doing acupuncture and doing chiropractic medicine and doing some really amazing integrative methods while I was still on active duty treating my soldier population. And so I started integrating a lot of those methods because they were honestly working. And so I was able to really start tuning my understanding of what I&#8217;m going to refer to as an east meets west philosophy of medicine is that by all means, I am so grateful that our healthcare system is what it is today. We have medications or we especially have antibiotics that are just crucial to helping people not die from the illnesses. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did, at least, you know, in excess of 100 years ago. But what that also being said is that like our bodies have always been very similar throughout the ages. And so we have realized that, you know, when somebody has a positive benefit that they do every single day, that that actually is more beneficial than going to see someone when you&#8217;re actually ill instead of like having a, a, a understanding of I&#8217;m going to go see somebody when I&#8217;m at disease instead what we need to do is we need to put ourselves at ease by making sure that we follow a very good lifestyle. And so I became an integrative physician assistant actually outside of my time in the service because I was medically retired from the military about five years ago. And I started being able to see patients and really working toward a where I was managing patients with very little to almost no medicine. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, I don&#8217;t giving up very many opioids if at any I don&#8217;t think I gave out any other medications. And I was able to really manage a lot of, you know, chronic conditions or help give people an idea of how to actually manage these chronic conditions themselves. And it was really nice and empowering to be able to do that. And coming from a personal standpoint now, working at home with Jackie opened up my eyes to even more things because as she was gaining more knowledge about the Paleo lifestyle, we were looking into alternative ways to be able to support the health of our family and that&#8217;s where we came across a doterra essential oils. And so if you just want to like talk about like that personal portion of your journey if you will, like hey aren&#8217;t you, how you came across the oils, what they started initially doing for you. And then we&#8217;ll talk about what they even did for the family. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it was kind of, it kind of all happened by mistake. Actually. I never intended to, you know, joined Doterra and to build a business, let&#8217;s say that I was more looking for something to help my son. So there was this one time where, you know, my son, he was about one or two years old. He just kept waking up in the middle of the night with ear discomfort. And after so many times of this happening, you know, we started talking about putting tubes in and doing all this and that I really wanted to see if I could be more go more of a unconventional route with this. And so I wanted to try out a Melaleuca tea tree oil, which is really supposed to be great for your discomfort in, um, and it&#8217;s also safe to be used on little ones. And so I bought a starter kit that included some, you know, 10 of the most popular essential oils that you can use hundreds of different ways, you know, we were on a really tight budget at that time. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You remember we were rapidly paying off $50,000 of debt and spending $150 on a starter kit was a really, really big decision that we had to make. And um, and so I remember telling my husband, I believe I asked you if I could buy it as you were, as I was clicking. Okay. Now that one little decision has completely transformed our family, our, uh, our business. We became entrepreneurs because of it. It&#8217;s just crazy to think of how everything has just happened for a reason. Even my son&#8217;s poor ear discomfort. So, um, I remember buying it, I bought it for that purpose and I remember telling the person I purchased it from a really good friend of mine, Jill Winger of the prairie homestead that I was buying it and that she can really just leave me alone about, you know, doing the business of Doterra because I would never, ever, ever do any kind of network marketing company. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But um, so I bought it. I couldn&#8217;t wait for it to come in and test it out. And the essential oils completely blew me away. They smelled different than any oils I had bought before. I was used to buying essential oils off, you know, Amazon or from the food store. They had kind of an alcohol smell to them. So, and I was never really comfortable about putting these store bought oils on my kids. I used them for cleaning. I&#8217;m, I might have used them for diffusing even though now I wouldn&#8217;t recommend that. Um, but they were never something that we used medicinally or therapeutically. So I remember I couldn&#8217;t wait for my son to have, you know, some ear pain. So he woke up, I put some Melaleuca on the back of his ears, you don&#8217;t put it down that year, you put a kind of behind the ear down the jawline and I just remember his discomfort was almost instantly soothed and just a little bit of lavender to help calm him down. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We put in the diffuser and I just was blown away about how fast these oils worked and how effective they were without any side effects, without any, um, crazy ingredients that I can&#8217;t read that I&#8217;m afraid to put on my kids and just so pure and just work so great. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s God for you. You know what I mean? He put these plants on this earth for a purpose and that&#8217;s for us to tap into the power of his medicine. And so I&#8217;m just grateful that we were able to find that and it kind of led us down our journey of using essential oils and now we&#8217;ve been using them for. We&#8217;re coming up next month on five years. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here&#8217;s a quick little tidbit for you is that as she was saying that about how all of these essential oils are plant based, uh, honestly, even our medicines, this, the medicines that we now know of, we literally have hundreds of medicines for various different things. Over 300 of those actually have the basis in a plant. That&#8217;s where we actually first started with a lot of our anesthesia. A lot of our anesthesia comes from something like Belladonna. And so all of our, our, excuse me, I should say over 300 medicine&#8217;s already have a plant base. So we were like, well, why don&#8217;t we go back to the plants at, that&#8217;s where all of the therapeutic properties can be. And so we really started cleaning that up and being able to look at something that had one ingredient, you know, or five ingredients rather than something had an entire side of a package with a lot of different chemicals that we couldn&#8217;t even actually pronounce, you know. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we wanted to really look into cleaning all of that up. And the reason why, one of the reasons why I know that we started doterra was because Jackie was also looking for a way for us to be able to purchase organic food. Um, we want it to not only take the step in trying to functionally move better and get better sleep and stuff like that, but we also want to look at our food. Food is like, you know, 75, 80 percent of it, uh, one staggering statistic is that now over 80 million Americans suffer from or should say, excuse me, 80 percent of Americans suffer from one chronic illness. And so, uh, the, the amount of money that is spent every single year is in the trillions on managing those chronic conditions. And we have found out through plenty of evidence based medicine articles is that if we take care of ourselves through the appropriate diet and exercise regimen that anyone of us can perform, we can actually substantially reduce, if not eliminate a lot of these preventable diseases. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that&#8217;s the thing about these diseases is that they are actually preventable. They are not something that somebody just so happens to get. These are things that people develop over time and it&#8217;s because of those poor lifestyle choices is that we&#8217;re finding out that these things are actually in fact preventable. You know, things like illness or infection or any of those sorts of things. Yes. They still do get some people from time to time, but by and far high blood pressure, high cholesterol isn&#8217;t leading to cardiovascular disease. Things of that nature. Those are what really truly get a lot of Americans. And so I started using essential oils myself and I wanted to look for a different way to be able to manage a lot of my baggage that came as well from my time in the service. And I do remember specifically I was talking about ways to ground me better because I did have symptoms that were related to conditions and situations that happened to me while I was deployed and I was coming back with a lot of those feelings of anxiousness and and depressive symptoms and things like that where I was just, you know, a guarded and withdrawing from people and all those sorts of things. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I really wanted to say like I&#8217;m going to take a stand for what I know I actually am rather than allowing these things to define who they want me to be. And so I looked into different essential oil blends and oils and all of that and I&#8217;ve come up with some really good ones that I cannot see them not being a part of my life. And so I wanted to make sure that we share that with you, is that we&#8217;re going to be also doing a podcast of essential oils. We&#8217;re going to start off with some essential oils, as a to help folks that are listening to this understand, you know, like what does melaleuca do, what are all the benefits of Melaleuca, what does it even mean to apply it, where to apply it. Things like that. And we&#8217;re also going to talk about different recipes and different things that we do not only on our homestead, what with our families. And then we&#8217;re going to bring other people who have been doing this same thing onto the podcast to do interviews and get their takes about what, how essential oils have revolutionized their life as well. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. It&#8217;ll be a totally separate podcast from this because we know some of you might not want to hear all about oils and so we&#8217;ll keep that on a separate podcast that we&#8217;ll share with you once we have it live so you guys can follow that. If you&#8217;re excited about hearing more about how to use essential oils, which ones Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use and so forth. Because this podcast that you&#8217;re listening to is going to be about what we call unconventional wellness and unconventional wellness to me is four to five different foundational things that we can be doing every single day in order to be able to really achieve that lifestyle that we&#8217;ve always wanted. And so I&#8217;ve been able to learn over the years as a practicing PA, as a father, as a husband, and really just as a friend who. A lot of other veterans. I have learned some different amazing ways to be able to handle these sorts of things without conventional means. And so we want to talk to you. We&#8217;re going to talk to you about diet, we&#8217;re going to talk to you about all the different diets that are out there. I don&#8217;t like the word Diet because diet to me is already a fatal flaw in the word Diet, right? Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like yes and no foods. And that&#8217;s not food freedom. That&#8217;s exactly right. So instead what we look at it now as, I think that we have a baseline of foods that we look at that we can always go back to and that yes, we Jackie said earlier that we are Paleo Ish. Like we like pizza, you know, and so like we might have pizza every once in a while. It&#8217;s not that every day of the week meal, um, it might be once monthly or something like that. But you know, there&#8217;s really great tasting food out there that we know come from very good sources. So you know, we have to face it like this, if, if, if people don&#8217;t appreciate the taste of food, they&#8217;re not going to eat it. Food has to be tasty and so we&#8217;re going to talk and uncovering an and develop all of these understandings of all those different quote unquote diets out there. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got the ketogenic diet. We&#8217;ve got the Mediterranean diet, what&#8217;s intermittent fasting all about. We&#8217;ll talk about the Paleo Diet and we&#8217;ll just talk about all these different nutritional regimens that will help you get what you are looking for. And Oh, by the way, we want to make sure that we make a budget friendly as well. So we&#8217;ll talk about all the little tricks and tips and those sorts of things that we&#8217;ve been able to uncover to keep our food bill low, but yet still eat food that we know is going to be nourishing for our bodies. So the next thing that we&#8217;ll talk about of course will also be functional movement. When I think functional movement, I just think like by definition it means multiplanar multi joints movement that you do every single day. So like when I squat down to pick up something that is a functional movement when I lived something over my head, if I do that, I&#8217;m doing a functional movement. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to talk about different ways to improve all four aspects of your fitness, not just strength and not just cardiovascular endurance, but two very important things that I think as we get older are extremely important. Our balance and flexibility and that is something that a lot of us lose throughout the years because we don&#8217;t focus on that. And so we&#8217;re going to talk about functional movement and, and, and develop into that and uncover that and pat unpackage that so we can understand it so we can start applying it as well. We&#8217;re also going to talk about how to get better sleep. I read a great book by Dr Ben Lynch. It&#8217;s called Dirty Genes. Uh, it&#8217;s amazing. Epigenetics in our life are actually starting to be an understood more and more every single day. So like, you know, you aren&#8217;t what you are made of. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DNA doesn&#8217;t determine your destiny. And so we&#8217;re finding out that a lot of environmental choices that we can make directly influence our health, and Dr Ben Lynch discusses what is known as eight delicious hours of sleep and I love that terminology by hand because it means exactly that like, yes, we might sleep in an eight hour window, but really are you getting restorative sleep when you do that? So we&#8217;re going to unpackage that as well. Talk about some sleep hygiene things and help you understand hopefully how to get better sleep as well. In addition to, we&#8217;re going to talk about stress. We&#8217;re going to talk about adversity. We&#8217;re going to talk about feelings of anxiousness. How do we combat those and really understand that in the baseline of how we are as human beings. We are emotional creatures, we think emotionally, but we also react emotionally and so we&#8217;re gonna start developing the understanding of the Mammalian and the reptilian brain and then the fact that we have a very wonderful blessing of our ability to make sense out of what we&#8217;re feeling and then how to channel those feelings in the appropriate way. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that I&#8217;ve learned in particular is I have to embrace my emotions and understand that are a part of me, but the fact of the matter is, is that I have time to process those emotions and not have to react to the ways that I am feeling instead. And so we&#8217;re going to talk about stress as a great deal. And then one other thing that I know that Jackie would probably love to talk about just here really quick. It&#8217;s probably about detoxification. We started looking at ways to detoxify both inside and outside of our home. And we&#8217;ll talk about different things like BPA. We&#8217;ll talk about, uh, you know, different types of toxins like voc is and all those other wonderful acronyms that are out there that have all of these really detrimental longterm effects to us. But unfortunately we come across those every single day. We&#8217;ll also talk about emf says, well, so I&#8217;m gonna let Jackie sort of unpackage that a little bit. Uh, right now. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we really didn&#8217;t even get into the whole detoxification stuff until about two years ago. Um, we had just experienced our third miscarriage and I just knew there was a reason I was one of those women. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;ve got to find out why I keep having a miscarriage. And so I had read some stuff online in a book I was reading on Mthfr. Frank can tell you what that stands for it because I can&#8217;t say it. Go ahead. Oh, are you going to put me on the spot? Essentially it is. No, it&#8217;s, I, I, I sat that I can say Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I can&#8217;t say it, but long story short for those listeners, I promise we&#8217;ll say on the next podcast, but it is the enzyme that is responsible for methylating meaning like to put a c, h, two or a ch three group. If you are ever a follower of organic chemistry and by doing that it either turns the switch on or turns the switch off and allowing your genes to actually do something. But what Mthfr is responsible for, I do know that the r stands for reductase. I do know that. But anyway, what it&#8217;s responsible for his methodology. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So just say that the abbreviation is pretty spot on. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s like methyl hydro, Tetra method of Hydra, my thought, Ethel tycho hydro reductase or something like that. But I promise I&#8217;ll get it absolutely right. We just know it by the acronym Mthfr because a lot of us are affected by it. We may not necessarily know there were affected by it and it is something that is crucial in being able to help detoxify our bodies. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I knew that when I read this article I was like one of the, one of the um, reasons that you could miscarry as, because you have this Mthfr gene mutation. And so I wanted to find out if I had this because some of the symptoms of it are, some of the symptoms are not only miscarriage but you&#8217;re extremely low in b vitamins. You are, what are some of the other sides on this? So it&#8217;s interrelated. You can&#8217;t process folic acid. So like the biggest thing that most people understand is that they become bad processes of folic acid and that is true, but he didn&#8217;t know that they watch for what would some of the symptoms be? Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, you know, just like your regular stuff that you would have from any type of a deficiency if you&#8217;ve ever been deficient in any one of the major vitamins like aed or k, you know, you&#8217;re going to have some lethargy, you&#8217;re going to have some fatigue. Uh, you&#8217;re going to have low levels of sleep, uh, you&#8217;re going to have low levels of energy. Um, it might actually cause weight gain and males. It can cause some weight gain and females. So just sort of like these very like something ain&#8217;t right type of symptoms could be totally related to Mthfr. There are more specific symptoms, but really a lot of those blah, blah feelings can be related to Mthfr. But, uh, but really the biggest thing that take away from that is it&#8217;s a complex environment in which our bodies operate. And so Mthfr is just one piece to another wise, larger puzzle. And so we&#8217;ll talk about how to, how to, how to unpackage all of that because we want to make sure that you are given all the understanding that you could possibly get to be able to really truly that we live in a toxic environment, but you don&#8217;t have to live in a toxic environment all the time and how to detoxify yourself when you&#8217;ve been exposed to those types of things as well. Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, and that&#8217;s kind of what I was getting at is that when I discovered that I did have one of the Mthfr gene mutations, I, um, I realized how important it is for somebody who has this to detoxify and that, um, you know, you have to make sure that you are constantly detoxifying yourself. So, you know, that&#8217;s where we got into doing detox baths, you know, not just for me and frank, since we both have this Mthfr, we are pretty positive that our kids have it. So we kind of treat them like they do because we haven&#8217;t had them tested yet. But, um, you know, detox baths with epsom salts and baking soda. Some essential oils if you want to put in there and just sitting in there for 20 minutes, sweating, you know, that is an amazing detoxification. That&#8217;s not going to cost you any money really just for the salt and the oil is of use, but you know, if you can&#8217;t go buy a sauna, sauna is another really great way to detoxify drinking lemon water. Another really great way to detoxify, you know, and detoxifying your home, making sure that you&#8217;re not cleaning with chemicals is really, really important. Your breathing those in, you know, you&#8217;re breathing. I&#8217;m in through the ninth through the day constantly if you&#8217;re cleaning with them. So, um, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s kind of some of the things that we&#8217;ll talk to you about. An unconventional wellness radio is um, just how to detoxify your body in your house. Frank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here&#8217;s the actual one, right? Methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase. So I was awfully close to go. I just said methyl tetrahydrofolate life. But needless to say, it&#8217;s still a reductase. And long story short is that we will uncover what we have learned about that as well. And then we&#8217;ll also talk about like one of Dr Lynch&#8217;s really great ways of being able to being able to sort of clean up your dirty jeans. And when I say jeans, I mean g e n e s not blue, jeans like j e a n s a very good play on words by Dr Lynch. But anyway, thank you so much for joining me. It has been an absolute pleasure. I mean it&#8217;s also been a pleasure for the last 11 years, but I really appreciate you coming on here and sharing some wisdom and your story and I just cannot wait to see what we can bring to people and help them live an unconventional life. You have anything else that you want to say? Jackie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32:06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. I&#8217;m excited for this podcast.

       " 'summary': \"Today, we get to discuss nutrition and its importance to health with Dr. Edwin McDonald, a gastroenterologist from the University of Chicago.\\n\\nHere are the notes from today's show:\\n\\nIntro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone and welcome to unconventional wellness radio, powerful and inspiring podcast Set to revolutionize and disrupt healthcare. It's time to put you in the driver's seat to be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone. This is Frank from unconventional wellness radio and I have the special pleasure and privilege of being able to bring in my new friend Dr Edwin Mcdonald on the call today. Dr Edwin Mcdonald is a board certified gastroenterologist who teaches at the University of Chicago and he of course also sees patients there and he is also the associate director of human nutrition at the University of Chicago. And I had the great pleasure of meeting Dr Mcdonald a very recently, a matter of fact here in the Asheville area at the Healthy Eating in Conference Practice, uh, which was held by an organization called Asap, which is a great organization. It's a nonprofit trying to bring about awareness of sustainable agriculture. And they had this conference where they had folks who are just getting started with their medical careers. And then folks like Dr. Mcdonald has been practicing for a while, but they're doing very innovative and very cool things with the attrition and the bringing in all of these other aspects of wellness. And so Dr Mcdonald was a pleasure to have you on the call today.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, what's up, frank? And I'm honored to be here. Really appreciate everything that she's doing. So, uh, thanks for having me on the show, man.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. So one of the things that captivated us was your story that you, you're just a natural storyteller and I really want to share you with everybody out there in the, uh, the unconventional wellness world about just how brilliant is the journey has been for you leading up to your eventual deciding to go to medical school, but you really have this really great history of culinary arts. If you don't mind, why don't you go ahead and just kind of tell us a bit of that story of how you got started with that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So, you know, it's really interesting story about how I got into medicine. So, um, you know, originally what inspired me to get into medicine. Thanks. And my great grandfather who had never met before because he passed away before I was born, like before I was born. So I'm actually at when Mcdonald was for a, so I'm the fourth generation of men in my family with that name. And my son is assist. Uh, but my great grandfather was a actually a physician. Um, so we hear these stories about like how amazing this guy was. Um, and I have his name, but I never met him. Um, so I've always felt like I was, you know, living in that shadow. So he, uh, he was born in like 1893 or something like that. And his father was actually born a slave. Uh, so was born like before slavery ended.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just a baby at that time. Um, but my great grandfather ended up going to medical school at northwestern, which I didn't really know until I was actually a medical student at northwestern. Like I thought he went to medical school somewhere else and I literally found out when I was a medical student, coincidentally at northwestern. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, my great grandfather, it's funny, he was a pediatrician here in Chicago, so, uh, at that time African Americans can only go to certain hospitals. Do you know the way the world was that time? Of course, the unfortunate. Yeah. But that's, I mean, that was the reality of it. So, uh, he was a pediatrician in the hospital that was the only house in Chicago that was the African American and uh, as a result, a lot of my patients who are like in their nineties now actually his patients.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that right? Yeah. You never even knew that you were going to follow in his footsteps. And we actually have the same patient to some degree, but I have at least at least maybe 15 patients that had my great grandfather as their. Yeah. So I got into a, that's how I originally got interested in the medicine and um, subsequently, uh, you know, went to medical school and all that good stuff. But I got into nutrition primarily. It really started when I was younger. I always enjoy cooking from my grandmothers, taught me how to cook and everything. Uh, when I was younger, my mom was off in the hospital frequently, so I had to be the person that cooked for the family. So, uh, one of my grandmothers and, you know, these are like matriarchs of the family, so they really sat me, gave me cookbooks, you know, I'm like 10 years old, flipping through July of cooking, trying to find recipes for the family.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, I loved it. So I ended up with a halfway decent cook. And in fast forward to my teenage years, I started working at Mcdonald's and actually became a manager at McDonald's. So when I was working there, uh, I will see these families who will come in to Mcdonald's every day for dinner or some people come in every morning for breakfast. And I, you know, I just thought something was odd about that. Um, I don't really have the medical terminology to express what I thought was odd about it, but something just didn't seem right about people going to Mcdonald's every single day all the time, you know. So I started cooking thing. So then that wasn't on the menu. So I'll make omelets in the morning like you can't get, you know, Mcdonald's, but I would take the, the Canadian Bacon from the egg mcmuffins and the onions from the big Mac, uh, and the eggs from the egg mcmuffins and, you know, put them all on the skillet and own the grill and make omlettes.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and it got to the point where my Mcdonald's had a secret many became the iron chef at Mcdonald's there just for one, you shouldn't have. I should've put a 16 year old and anything. This is true and that's what you get. You get secret menu at Mcdonald's on the 16 year old is running the show. Uh, but, you know, for whatever reason, people enjoyed it. And uh, you know, seeing the fact that people enjoy what I was doing, a really showed me how important cooking was outside of my own home. You know, cooking for your family is one thing. But then when you start cooking for other people and really seeing how the positive impact that can have on somebody outside of people who actually like or no, you, uh, it's good. Uh, and that's something that I carried with you throughout Undergrad and subsequently in medical school.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I got into medical school, uh, you started learning about disease. Um, you know, for the most part in Undergrad and high school, you don't really learn about it disease and like what goes wrong with the human body and why. Uh, so even though I had this premed curriculum that was all science class, it wasn't actually learning about what happens to people and why, why things happen to people. So medical school was my first exposure to some of those concepts. And I remember being in some of those lectures sitting in front of the class and lectures would say, you know, we'll have a talk on diabetes. And they're like, well, diabetes, most of the reason why people have diabetes type two diabetes United States is because of the foods that we, uh, high blood pressure people in the United States eat too much sodium a heart disease. People eat foods that are too high in cholesterol. So I wouldn't raise my hand after all those lecturers and ask the lecturer, uh, well, what should we be eating? And uh, there will be a blank face, a blank stare on their face and no one would have a response. They will just say, well, we need right.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one would actually define with eating right was, um, and I would sit in the front of the class and a lot of these conditions disproportionately affect African Americans. And for me as an African American, you know, I'm asking the question not only as a position but also for myself, like I don't want to get diabetes for sure. Sure. I don't want to have high blood pressure. Uh, so, you know, there was definitely a desire to help others. But there was also, you know, I'm asking the question, how is self preservation to some degree? And no one would give me an answer and that effect, people will get annoyed. Like, why are you asking this question? So, you know, medical school, it didn't really, it just said these were the problem, but we didn't really learn about solutions. I mean, we learned about pharmacology. What medications the kids for high blood pressure.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can tell you a dozen medications for high blood pressure, but your average Dr probably couldn't tell you a dozen foods that can help with high blood pressure. Um, so that's something that, that carry on that I took when I went to a, become a resident and as a resident when I started having my own clinic, I had a clinic at the Jesse Brown VA where I had the privilege of taking care of veterans and like I told you at the conference and everyone at the conference, I really appreciate it taking care of that. Uh, if I had to pick out the one and one of the most important parts of my training, uh, probably my exposure to the veterans and, you know, being able to provide care for them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an amazing experience to be able to hang out with the World War II veterans, Korean War veterans and a Vietnam veterans. Most of the patients at that time with Vietnam veteran. And then, uh, at that time, uh, some of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, you know, I saw the first wave of people coming back. So, you know, people were able to share the experiences without what you're actually talking to one of those on the podcasts right now.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I was, I was a Iraq war veteran, so it's so know for me, uh, I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for the veterans. And then I also really appreciated hearing their stories and perspective because you know, what we see on the news and what really goes down. These aren't necessarily one and the same and you don't really know that until you have the opportunity to talk to somebody about that. So for me, you know, it was humbling. Uh, but I learned a lot and I didn't want that. If it's one of those experiences that you really. Well first of all we say you,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a veteran. We love our physicians and so if I tell you we thank you for your service as well and that uh, and that there really is like just value in hanging out with the veteran community because there's just so many stories like we come from all corners of the United States and to be able to descend what that common thread of curving, you know, and then just the networking that goes along with that is just changing. So, and\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a side note for you listeners, if you guys have any politicians that threatened to take funding away from the Va hospital and does not want to give va hospital needs, like those politicians are terrible and you should not support them. Uh, and you know, you can quote me on that and calling you versus Chicago Hospital and tell them, I said Mcdonald, you have to add an a to z so you'll still be able to find it. But yeah, no, thank you for that. So I had one veteran in particular and he talked about his story at the conference. So I'm a young intern. I have my clinic and I came into medicine with a certain degree of idealism. I'm very idealistic and I want to be this great doctor and I really want to help people and I see this patient for the first time, uh, I look over his chair, get his history and I see all the notes from other doctors and he had all the common diseases that affect Americans.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, had a mild stroke in the past, you know, mild heart attack and the path also had fatty liver disease is probably 100, 150 pounds overweight. And he also recently got divorced because he had erectile dysfunction. Uh, so with all the stuff he had gone on as far as health issues that lead to erectile dysfunction, which led to the divorce. And then plus, you know, he had some depression and you know, a whole bunch of things going on. And I lived through his chart. Every time we will come to the doctor, his blood pressure would be a little bit elevated. And when my colleague, which is add on another blood pressure medication or increase the dose blood pressure medication, if he came in, let's see, it could be a little bit higher and you know, every person, all they would do with that, another medication on our increased insulin and insulin actually promotes weight gain. So as his insulin, uh, as, as, as insulin builds with increasing his weight was simultaneously increasing with it. Um, he would have a heart attack, you know, they just give them aspirin or you will go from a baby aspirin to a full dose aspirin. And I was the response to heart attack, uh, if I may\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the workers for the benefit of the listeners. Dr McDonald, I wanted to let you guys know where there's a, there's a description is that I'm, I'm a, I'm a physician assistant. I didn't necessarily say that, but you guys probably know that to me, my other podcast. But that's something that we call it polypharmacy. And there's a way that a lot of Americans these days are being managed is that it's like if one blood pressure medication isn't working, there is a complimentary blood, my blood pressure medication that has been created, different class of medication, but then you ended up running into patients that are on five, six, seven medication to handle all these conditions that Dr Mcdonald was talking about. And then you can run into a slew of possible side effects that may or may not be going on. You know, like one of the most typical side effects with somebody like in the veterans community, the antidepressants is going to be erectile dysfunction and you have to watch out for some of the medications that folks are on commonly because a lot of folks just will tack these medications on. They do a quick little scrub, but then they're on five or six medications, which I don't know if anybody really likes to do that. But that's the concept of polypharmacy if that's okay. Then I ended that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh definitely, definitely. And then for me as a physician, I don't want to downplay the need for medication because in many situations people need medications, medications, and well study to, you know, have some positive benefits for absolutely scenarios, but when you use medications without addressing the underlying problem, um, I think it's like know, I don't want to say the elephant in the room, but for lack of a better analogy, like we're ignoring the obvious in certain situations in his situation. No one address what he was eating. And for me I felt like it was, there was obviously an issue or obviously something that we should talk about. But when I looked through all the notes, I didn't see any comment on what he was eating. I didn't see any, uh, you know, dietician though switching, unfortunately America, it's actually hard to sit down with a dietician, a.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most insurance companies don't pay for dieticians and Medicare, Medicaid, you know, good luck. You have to have really bad diabetes to be able to sit down with a Dietitian or um, and, and even still, they may not cover everything. Uh, so it's just like, why do you have to wait till you have diabetes in order to see a dietician? Like we should see Dietitians so we won't get diabetes. Right. That's a whole separate conversation. So I sat down and I asked them a simple question. I'm like, hey man, you know, so I see you have all these diseases that done from diet, like, what are you eating? And you just told me how and you know, I didn't think he meant hot dogs for every meal. So I asked them, I'm like, well, what are you doing for breakfast? And you know, he calmly said hot dogs.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I'm like, well, what are you doing for lunch? And he seemed a little bit, a little bit more annoyed. I could hear it in his voice a little bit, a little bit of anger and he's just like hot dogs. And then I asked them again, I'm like, okay, well what are you, what are you doing for dinner now? At this point I could tell he was visibly annoyed. Like he stood up, he looked like he was gonna walk out and I'm just like, listen, work with me man. And then he said hot dog again. Um, and so I realized he was really just eating hot dogs every single meal. Uh, and, and these weren't even hot dogs with relish on it. It was no festival whatsoever. It was just the hot dog and he didn't put ketchup on it. It was hot dogs and mustard because in Chicago, you know, Chicago style dog typically does not have ketchup on it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So he was just more of a southern thing I suppose. Yeah. I, you know, I should look up the history of that. But, uh, nonetheless, he was just eating hot dogs with mustard and, and I, you know, I told them, I'm like, you can't live on hot dogs. That is, that is not a life promoting dies, if anything that is a death promoting died show. And I realized we had to make some changes. So I gave them a recipe, a nothing fancy at that point in my life. And I knew how to cook what I wasn't a trained chef or anything like that. So I gave them a recipe. I just said, look man, what vegetables do you like? And he was just like, well, I love Broccoli, I love cauliflower. And I'm like, okay, cool. We can work with Broccoli. Um, I told him to basically just put some grass on cauliflower and Broccoli.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some olive oil on it, a little bit of salt, not too much because you have high blood pressure, a roasted and up and put it in for 25 roasted for 15, 20 minutes, get a little bit drawn and not too much. It'll come out the list. And he said, okay. I wrote down the recipe, we shook hands and I thought I'd come back and see me in three months. So three months later he comes back and I mean, he's like 40, 50 pounds down if he complained of dizziness because blood sugar was going low periodically. And also his blood pressure, uh, was a lot lower than what it has been a. So I'm looking at this guy, you know, I think the guy had cancer or something. I'm like, man, we need to check your prostate, like what was going on, did you get colonoscopy because she lost all this weight and I'm and I'm like, what have you been eating?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he basically was like, well, I stopped eating the hotdogs and I just ate the roasted vegetables. I'm like, well what's your this? And he wrote us lunch and you got a little bit of Noi roasted vegetables, dinner, the same thing. So he essentially switched over to a plant based diet and found that his blood pressure was low. Again, the blood sugar is on the low side. So we had to slowly decreases insulin. We had to slowly decreases blood pressure medication and you know, being on just Broccoli and cauliflower alone, that's not the healthiest diet to be on. And the longterm of. So we had the, you know, add some more plant based sources of protein and things of that nature and other, you know, variety of different vegetables. But know nonetheless, he switched over to becoming a vegetarian. And, you know, one thing that stood out that stood out to me, he said, when he lost all that weight, uh, he noticed that he can like his buddies, uh, whereas before, when he had so much weight on him, he couldn't really do that anymore.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost more weight, even mentioned that he had an easier time tying his shoes and put on his socks on. Whereas before, you know, he couldn't really put his socks on easy. Like it was a struggle. Uh, he had to have, you know, different tools to help him get his socks on and just, you know, simple things like being able to wipe himself easily and put it in the socks on, was his motivation to take things a step further. So, you know, he started riding his bike, he started, um, you know, walking more and started engaging in more physical activity. And, you know, subsequently as a result, he started feeling better. His depression got a little bit better. Uh, his erectile dysfunction got better. He started dating and you know, what I took away from that story was this was just all food, uh, this had nothing to do with me as a physician, you know, that there was no, uh, you know, it wasn't like a, I was, you know, the coaches it notre dam or something.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving them a great speech that inspired him. It wasn't like that. It was just, he just changed his diet and if anything he inspired me, uh, to, to talk about this with more patients because the change I saw him, I'm like, you know, can we replicate this? Can other people do what he did? Uh, and I found that yes, people can and people want to, um, we just have to give people the right guy to do that. Um, so that's why I decided eventually to after residency, a study nutrition and got to color in your school and get certified as a chef. So when I was doing my fellowship and nutrition at the newer Chicago, uh, that fellowship was mostly here towards clinical nutrition, which is very different than just talking about food. So clinical nutrition is really a, using a tpn and ivy nutrition, uh, and you know, placing feeding tubes and people's stomachs and stuff like that and feeding them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's really a sick population of patients. So these are people who've had severe injuries, uh, you know, be from trauma or car crashes and you know, a lot of their bowel has been removed so they can't include the regular way, uh, or people who have cancer and the cancer is blocking her bowels and we have to figure out ways to is to give them so they can survive, you know, as they're finishing chemotherapy. So a really sick population of patients. Uh, but then at fellowship wasn't teaching me about, you know, how to feed people who have diabetes. It wasn't talking about like everyday stuff. Uh, so that's, that's why I went to culinary arts school and in the evening and got trained as a chef and a, culinary arts training. Uh, you had to actually take a nutrition class. And the crazy thing is, you know, throughout medical school, I didn't have a nutrition class. I had to go to culinary arts school to get my first class and nutrition. Wow. And I went to a top notch medical school. I mean like one of the best in the country.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's crazy. But that, that's like the state of healthcare nowadays. And that also explains why, you know, we spend all this money on healthcare. We're the number one in the world when it comes to health spending. But in terms of, you know, our actual longevity, I think the United States where it's like 31st 33 in the world as far as how long were you actually living was there's a huge disconnect. Like we spend all this money but we don't necessarily get the outcome that we're paying for. So a lot of it has to do with we're, we're missing the simple stuff. And the simple stuff is important. So yes, you know, you can get the craziest complex surgery here. Uh, you can come see me for colonoscopies and I can take out polyps and possibly move cancers and you know, all these problems. But when it comes to, you know, the foundation for preventing some of these problems, uh, I think there's a lot of room for improvement in that space and you know, doctors play a role, uh, but there's a lot of stuff that can be done outside of the hospital and you know, the kitchen is just as important.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the kitchen is probably as important as the medicine cabinet.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, I just thank you so much for sharing that by the way. Ours is my, my second time, maybe third time hearing that story and it just gets better every time I hear it. He was like, I just get some nuggets out of it. So thank you so much for sharing that Dr Mcdonald and I think I echo exactly what you're setting and uh, and what this entire, you know, what does the entire concept of unconventional one of us is really centered around is still the patient provider relationship. There's still massive value in that. And I think that we both can say that we appreciate the fact that we live in a society where we do have major advancements in medical care. I mean, people are getting cured from different types of cancers all the time, all around the world. I mean, we might be on the cost of actually understanding.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, we now live in a world where we can treat hepatitis C, where we never. We never thought about that when I was going through PA school or medical school. Yeah. That was it. We were talking about, you know, these folks possibly having to go on the liver transplant list, but now we have a medication that could do it. So amen to the, to the advancements that we have in our medical care. But yes, some of those statistics that came out of the same conference that we attended was a, you know, it's unbelievable how 80 percent of Americans have a preventable disease. We don't die from tuberculosis anymore in this country, you know? Yeah. We'll get cases of it and stuff like that. But other, by and far these things have been treated and we thankfully have a society free of them. Um, but of that 80 percent of American, um, you know, depending upon, I guess the, the source that you're looking at.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen it as high as $2,000,000,000,000 in American medical costs to actually manage those 80 percent of Americans who have a preventable disease and so there's got to be. There's a problem here and I think that the biggest disconnect starts with the choices that we as the patients are actually making and so we need to empower our physicians, I think to let them understand that we want this and we need this and that. I don't care to be seen by a doctor, you know, many times throughout my entire year, I would love to come in, shake a hand, maybe have to do my colonoscopy when I'm 50 and you know, everything looks good. Mr Ritz, take care. Of, you know, I would love to. We would love for it to be like that, but you're absolutely right. I think that we are really losing touch with food. It's becoming far too easy for us to look at a way\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying, I just need this food. Maybe it is fast. We have a very fast food mentality and I'm not talking about just fast as restaurants. I think I'm talking about. We have this mentality that whole foods has made a massive market for themselves and they're a multibillion dollar corporation on the sense that yes, they sell good food, but the thing is, is that they also, you know, the reason why they were able to get people into the door was that they were taking their good food and then we're making it fast. So you could walk up and say, I want this, I want this, I want this. They'll put it into a tray and then you're out the door. So at least we're eating healthy foods. But yes, it's still a fast food mentality. So let me think about whole foods. We act like wholesome is a brand new concept, but if you go back to the 19 seventies, you know, 50, 60 years, etc.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every grocery store will hold on it. It, you know, there wasn't a whoLe, like most of the vegetables organic. Uh, if you went to the deli section, do you had, you know, people who really worked at a deli section mate fluid in the deli section. Um, so if anything, wholefoods is just returning to, you know, simpler day what we just focused on absolute. Well. And then one of the other talks that I remember that you had during your discussion with us at the conference was a, you know, these food swamps, food deserts, you know, and so if you wouldn't mind, could you describe a little bit about the food swamps in food desert concept for whiskers? Yeah. So, you know, food deserts, it's a term that really became popular and then they 2000 and it really describes neighborhoods where there is a lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, grocery stories that contain, you know, fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these neIghborhoods have convenience stores but not necessarily full fledged grocery stores. Uh, so those are basically call it food deserts. And the term actually originated in scotland and originate and United States. United states kind of took it and ran with it. Um, so chicago, a city in which I live in a definitely have some food deserts and most of the food desert is actually, uh, an african american neighborhood. It's not all of them are african american neighborhood. Okay. Uh, so food deserts do not affect everyone equally. However, allow retail areas, which they don't really get as much attention as he deserved. A, are also qualified as food deserts for different reasons. And so even though real areas may have farms and stuff like that, but, um, the fruit growing on those farms may not actually get to the residents of those areas and many places.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those area technically can, are considered food deserts, a food swamps, a little bit different concept. If anything, it's more of a realistic concept because one, if you go to any urban community has designated a food desert. It's not like you won't see food. Uh, there's plenty of food joints and you know, a plenty convenience stores. Uh, and so in many ways, those areas or swamp a swamp, unhealthy food and the food swamps, if anything, that's really driving a problem. Uh, you know, imagine if you're, if you don't have a whole lot of money, a hit, you're hungry. And when you're driving home from work or walking home from work or taking the train from home from work or just, you know, walking around the neighborhood in general and you pass, you know, your favorite barbecue spot or your favorite chicken joint or you know, mcdonald's or whatever, and you have to walk by all of these places. Uh, and these are places are the list of foods. It's not like the food taste better places and it's so easy and so tempting just to walk in there and get, you know, three wings for $2 or interference for us. And it's hard to, to be healthy in that scenario. I mean, it takes, like I, I hate to say everyone wants to talk aboUt willpower and self control and like I feel like these concepts are unfair to some degree because it's hard out here.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's all the time that we have for today's podcast.

It's time to put you in the driver's seat to be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone. This is Frank from unconventional wellness radio and I have the special pleasure and privilege of being able to bring in my new friend Dr Edwin Mcdonald on the call today. Dr Edwin Mcdonald is a board certified gastroenterologist who teaches at the University of Chicago and he of course also sees patients there and he is also the associate director of human nutrition at the University of Chicago. And I had the great pleasure of meeting Dr Mcdonald a very recently, a matter of fact here in the Asheville area at the Healthy Eating in Conference Practice, uh, which was held by an organization called Asap, which is a great organization. It's a nonprofit trying to bring about awareness of sustainable agriculture. And they had this conference where they had folks who are just getting started with their medical careers. And then folks like Dr. Mcdonald has been practicing for a while, but they're doing very innovative and very cool things with the attrition and the bringing in all of these other aspects of wellness. And so Dr Mcdonald was a pleasure to have you on the call today.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, what's up, frank? And I'm honored to be here. Really appreciate everything that she's doing. So, uh, thanks for having me on the show, man.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. So one of the things that captivated us was your story that you, you're just a natural storyteller and I really want to share you with everybody out there in the, uh, the unconventional wellness world about just how brilliant is the journey has been for you leading up to your eventual deciding to go to medical school, but you really have this really great history of culinary arts. If you don't mind, why don't you go ahead and just kind of tell us a bit of that story of how you got started with that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So, you know, it's really interesting story about how I got into medicine. So, um, you know, originally what inspired me to get into medicine. Thanks. And my great grandfather who had never met before because he passed away before I was born, like before I was born. So I'm actually at when Mcdonald was for a, so I'm the fourth generation of men in my family with that name. And my son is assist. Uh, but my great grandfather was a actually a physician. Um, so we hear these stories about like how amazing this guy was. Um, and I have his name, but I never met him. Um, so I've always felt like I was, you know, living in that shadow. So he, uh, he was born in like 1893 or something like that. And his father was actually born a slave. Uh, so was born like before slavery ended.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just a baby at that time. Um, but my great grandfather ended up going to medical school at northwestern, which I didn't really know until I was actually a medical student at northwestern. Like I thought he went to medical school somewhere else and I literally found out when I was a medical student, coincidentally at northwestern. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, my great grandfather, it's funny, he was a pediatrician here in Chicago, so, uh, at that time African Americans can only go to certain hospitals. Do you know the way the world was that time? Of course, the unfortunate. Yeah. But that's, I mean, that was the reality of it. So, uh, he was a pediatrician in the hospital that was the only house in Chicago that was the African American and uh, as a result, a lot of my patients who are like in their nineties now actually his patients.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that right? Yeah. You never even knew that you were going to follow in his footsteps. And we actually have the same patient to some degree, but I have at least at least maybe 15 patients that had my great grandfather as their. Yeah. So I got into a, that's how I originally got interested in the medicine and um, subsequently, uh, you know, went to medical school and all that good stuff. But I got into nutrition primarily. It really started when I was younger. I always enjoy cooking from my grandmothers, taught me how to cook and everything. Uh, when I was younger, my mom was off in the hospital frequently, so I had to be the person that cooked for the family. So, uh, one of my grandmothers and, you know, these are like matriarchs of the family, so they really sat me, gave me cookbooks, you know, I'm like 10 years old, flipping through July of cooking, trying to find recipes for the family.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, I loved it. So I ended up with a halfway decent cook. And in fast forward to my teenage years, I started working at Mcdonald's and actually became a manager at McDonald's. So when I was working there, uh, I will see these families who will come in to Mcdonald's every day for dinner or some people come in every morning for breakfast. And I, you know, I just thought something was odd about that. Um, I don't really have the medical terminology to express what I thought was odd about it, but something just didn't seem right about people going to Mcdonald's every single day all the time, you know. So I started cooking thing. So then that wasn't on the menu. So I'll make omelets in the morning like you can't get, you know, Mcdonald's, but I would take the, the Canadian Bacon from the egg mcmuffins and the onions from the big Mac, uh, and the eggs from the egg mcmuffins and, you know, put them all on the skillet and own the grill and make omlettes.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and it got to the point where my Mcdonald's had a secret many became the iron chef at Mcdonald's there just for one, you shouldn't have. I should've put a 16 year old and anything. This is true and that's what you get. You get secret menu at Mcdonald's on the 16 year old is running the show. Uh, but, you know, for whatever reason, people enjoyed it. And uh, you know, seeing the fact that people enjoy what I was doing, a really showed me how important cooking was outside of my own home. You know, cooking for your family is one thing. But then when you start cooking for other people and really seeing how the positive impact that can have on somebody outside of people who actually like or no, you, uh, it's good. Uh, and that's something that I carried with you throughout Undergrad and subsequently in medical school.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I got into medical school, uh, you started learning about disease. Um, you know, for the most part in Undergrad and high school, you don't really learn about it disease and like what goes wrong with the human body and why. Uh, so even though I had this premed curriculum that was all science class, it wasn't actually learning about what happens to people and why, why things happen to people. So medical school was my first exposure to some of those concepts. And I remember being in some of those lectures sitting in front of the class and lectures would say, you know, we'll have a talk on diabetes. And they're like, well, diabetes, most of the reason why people have diabetes type two diabetes United States is because of the foods that we, uh, high blood pressure people in the United States eat too much sodium a heart disease. People eat foods that are too high in cholesterol. So I wouldn't raise my hand after all those lecturers and ask the lecturer, uh, well, what should we be eating? And uh, there will be a blank face, a blank stare on their face and no one would have a response. They will just say, well, we need right.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one would actually define with eating right was, um, and I would sit in the front of the class and a lot of these conditions disproportionately affect African Americans. And for me as an African American, you know, I'm asking the question not only as a position but also for myself, like I don't want to get diabetes for sure. Sure. I don't want to have high blood pressure. Uh, so, you know, there was definitely a desire to help others. But there was also, you know, I'm asking the question, how is self preservation to some degree? And no one would give me an answer and that effect, people will get annoyed. Like, why are you asking this question? So, you know, medical school, it didn't really, it just said these were the problem, but we didn't really learn about solutions. I mean, we learned about pharmacology. What medications the kids for high blood pressure.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can tell you a dozen medications for high blood pressure, but your average Dr probably couldn't tell you a dozen foods that can help with high blood pressure. Um, so that's something that, that carry on that I took when I went to a, become a resident and as a resident when I started having my own clinic, I had a clinic at the Jesse Brown VA where I had the privilege of taking care of veterans and like I told you at the conference and everyone at the conference, I really appreciate it taking care of that. Uh, if I had to pick out the one and one of the most important parts of my training, uh, probably my exposure to the veterans and, you know, being able to provide care for them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an amazing experience to be able to hang out with the World War II veterans, Korean War veterans and a Vietnam veterans. Most of the patients at that time with Vietnam veteran. And then, uh, at that time, uh, some of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, you know, I saw the first wave of people coming back. So, you know, people were able to share the experiences without what you're actually talking to one of those on the podcasts right now.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I was, I was a Iraq war veteran, so it's so know for me, uh, I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for the veterans. And then I also really appreciated hearing their stories and perspective because you know, what we see on the news and what really goes down. These aren't necessarily one and the same and you don't really know that until you have the opportunity to talk to somebody about that. So for me, you know, it was humbling. Uh, but I learned a lot and I didn't want that. If it's one of those experiences that you really. Well first of all we say you,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a veteran. We love our physicians and so if I tell you we thank you for your service as well and that uh, and that there really is like just value in hanging out with the veteran community because there's just so many stories like we come from all corners of the United States and to be able to descend what that common thread of curving, you know, and then just the networking that goes along with that is just changing. So, and\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a side note for you listeners, if you guys have any politicians that threatened to take funding away from the Va hospital and does not want to give va hospital needs, like those politicians are terrible and you should not support them. Uh, and you know, you can quote me on that and calling you versus Chicago Hospital and tell them, I said Mcdonald, you have to add an a to z so you'll still be able to find it. But yeah, no, thank you for that. So I had one veteran in particular and he talked about his story at the conference. So I'm a young intern. I have my clinic and I came into medicine with a certain degree of idealism. I'm very idealistic and I want to be this great doctor and I really want to help people and I see this patient for the first time, uh, I look over his chair, get his history and I see all the notes from other doctors and he had all the common diseases that affect Americans.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, had a mild stroke in the past, you know, mild heart attack and the path also had fatty liver disease is probably 100, 150 pounds overweight. And he also recently got divorced because he had erectile dysfunction. Uh, so with all the stuff he had gone on as far as health issues that lead to erectile dysfunction, which led to the divorce. And then plus, you know, he had some depression and you know, a whole bunch of things going on. And I lived through his chart. Every time we will come to the doctor, his blood pressure would be a little bit elevated. And when my colleague, which is add on another blood pressure medication or increase the dose blood pressure medication, if he came in, let's see, it could be a little bit higher and you know, every person, all they would do with that, another medication on our increased insulin and insulin actually promotes weight gain. So as his insulin, uh, as, as, as insulin builds with increasing his weight was simultaneously increasing with it. Um, he would have a heart attack, you know, they just give them aspirin or you will go from a baby aspirin to a full dose aspirin. And I was the response to heart attack, uh, if I may\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the workers for the benefit of the listeners. Dr McDonald, I wanted to let you guys know where there's a, there's a description is that I'm, I'm a, I'm a physician assistant. I didn't necessarily say that, but you guys probably know that to me, my other podcast. But that's something that we call it polypharmacy. And there's a way that a lot of Americans these days are being managed is that it's like if one blood pressure medication isn't working, there is a complimentary blood, my blood pressure medication that has been created, different class of medication, but then you ended up running into patients that are on five, six, seven medication to handle all these conditions that Dr Mcdonald was talking about. And then you can run into a slew of possible side effects that may or may not be going on. You know, like one of the most typical side effects with somebody like in the veterans community, the antidepressants is going to be erectile dysfunction and you have to watch out for some of the medications that folks are on commonly because a lot of folks just will tack these medications on. They do a quick little scrub, but then they're on five or six medications, which I don't know if anybody really likes to do that. But that's the concept of polypharmacy if that's okay. Then I ended that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh definitely, definitely. And then for me as a physician, I don't want to downplay the need for medication because in many situations people need medications, medications, and well study to, you know, have some positive benefits for absolutely scenarios, but when you use medications without addressing the underlying problem, um, I think it's like know, I don't want to say the elephant in the room, but for lack of a better analogy, like we're ignoring the obvious in certain situations in his situation. No one address what he was eating. And for me I felt like it was, there was obviously an issue or obviously something that we should talk about. But when I looked through all the notes, I didn't see any comment on what he was eating. I didn't see any, uh, you know, dietician though switching, unfortunately America, it's actually hard to sit down with a dietician, a.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most insurance companies don't pay for dieticians and Medicare, Medicaid, you know, good luck. You have to have really bad diabetes to be able to sit down with a Dietitian or um, and, and even still, they may not cover everything. Uh, so it's just like, why do you have to wait till you have diabetes in order to see a dietician? Like we should see Dietitians so we won't get diabetes. Right. That's a whole separate conversation. So I sat down and I asked them a simple question. I'm like, hey man, you know, so I see you have all these diseases that done from diet, like, what are you eating? And you just told me how and you know, I didn't think he meant hot dogs for every meal. So I asked them, I'm like, well, what are you doing for breakfast? And you know, he calmly said hot dogs.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I'm like, well, what are you doing for lunch? And he seemed a little bit, a little bit more annoyed. I could hear it in his voice a little bit, a little bit of anger and he's just like hot dogs. And then I asked them again, I'm like, okay, well what are you, what are you doing for dinner now? At this point I could tell he was visibly annoyed. Like he stood up, he looked like he was gonna walk out and I'm just like, listen, work with me man. And then he said hot dog again. Um, and so I realized he was really just eating hot dogs every single meal. Uh, and, and these weren't even hot dogs with relish on it. It was no festival whatsoever. It was just the hot dog and he didn't put ketchup on it. It was hot dogs and mustard because in Chicago, you know, Chicago style dog typically does not have ketchup on it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So he was just more of a southern thing I suppose. Yeah. I, you know, I should look up the history of that. But, uh, nonetheless, he was just eating hot dogs with mustard and, and I, you know, I told them, I'm like, you can't live on hot dogs. That is, that is not a life promoting dies, if anything that is a death promoting died show. And I realized we had to make some changes. So I gave them a recipe, a nothing fancy at that point in my life. And I knew how to cook what I wasn't a trained chef or anything like that. So I gave them a recipe. I just said, look man, what vegetables do you like? And he was just like, well, I love Broccoli, I love cauliflower. And I'm like, okay, cool. We can work with Broccoli. Um, I told him to basically just put some grass on cauliflower and Broccoli.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some olive oil on it, a little bit of salt, not too much because you have high blood pressure, a roasted and up and put it in for 25 roasted for 15, 20 minutes, get a little bit drawn and not too much. It'll come out the list. And he said, okay. I wrote down the recipe, we shook hands and I thought I'd come back and see me in three months. So three months later he comes back and I mean, he's like 40, 50 pounds down if he complained of dizziness because blood sugar was going low periodically. And also his blood pressure, uh, was a lot lower than what it has been a. So I'm looking at this guy, you know, I think the guy had cancer or something. I'm like, man, we need to check your prostate, like what was going on, did you get colonoscopy because she lost all this weight and I'm and I'm like, what have you been eating?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he basically was like, well, I stopped eating the hotdogs and I just ate the roasted vegetables. I'm like, well what's your this? And he wrote us lunch and you got a little bit of Noi roasted vegetables, dinner, the same thing. So he essentially switched over to a plant based diet and found that his blood pressure was low. Again, the blood sugar is on the low side. So we had to slowly decreases insulin. We had to slowly decreases blood pressure medication and you know, being on just Broccoli and cauliflower alone, that's not the healthiest diet to be on. And the longterm of. So we had the, you know, add some more plant based sources of protein and things of that nature and other, you know, variety of different vegetables. But know nonetheless, he switched over to becoming a vegetarian. And, you know, one thing that stood out that stood out to me, he said, when he lost all that weight, uh, he noticed that he can like his buddies, uh, whereas before, when he had so much weight on him, he couldn't really do that anymore.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost more weight, even mentioned that he had an easier time tying his shoes and put on his socks on. Whereas before, you know, he couldn't really put his socks on easy. Like it was a struggle. Uh, he had to have, you know, different tools to help him get his socks on and just, you know, simple things like being able to wipe himself easily and put it in the socks on, was his motivation to take things a step further. So, you know, he started riding his bike, he started, um, you know, walking more and started engaging in more physical activity. And, you know, subsequently as a result, he started feeling better. His depression got a little bit better. Uh, his erectile dysfunction got better. He started dating and you know, what I took away from that story was this was just all food, uh, this had nothing to do with me as a physician, you know, that there was no, uh, you know, it wasn't like a, I was, you know, the coaches it notre dam or something.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving them a great speech that inspired him. It wasn't like that. It was just, he just changed his diet and if anything he inspired me, uh, to, to talk about this with more patients because the change I saw him, I'm like, you know, can we replicate this? Can other people do what he did? Uh, and I found that yes, people can and people want to, um, we just have to give people the right guy to do that. Um, so that's why I decided eventually to after residency, a study nutrition and got to color in your school and get certified as a chef. So when I was doing my fellowship and nutrition at the newer Chicago, uh, that fellowship was mostly here towards clinical nutrition, which is very different than just talking about food. So clinical nutrition is really a, using a tpn and ivy nutrition, uh, and you know, placing feeding tubes and people's stomachs and stuff like that and feeding them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's really a sick population of patients. So these are people who've had severe injuries, uh, you know, be from trauma or car crashes and you know, a lot of their bowel has been removed so they can't include the regular way, uh, or people who have cancer and the cancer is blocking her bowels and we have to figure out ways to is to give them so they can survive, you know, as they're finishing chemotherapy. So a really sick population of patients. Uh, but then at fellowship wasn't teaching me about, you know, how to feed people who have diabetes. It wasn't talking about like everyday stuff. Uh, so that's, that's why I went to culinary arts school and in the evening and got trained as a chef and a, culinary arts training. Uh, you had to actually take a nutrition class. And the crazy thing is, you know, throughout medical school, I didn't have a nutrition class. I had to go to culinary arts school to get my first class and nutrition. Wow. And I went to a top notch medical school. I mean like one of the best in the country.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's crazy. But that, that's like the state of healthcare nowadays. And that also explains why, you know, we spend all this money on healthcare. We're the number one in the world when it comes to health spending. But in terms of, you know, our actual longevity, I think the United States where it's like 31st 33 in the world as far as how long were you actually living was there's a huge disconnect. Like we spend all this money but we don't necessarily get the outcome that we're paying for. So a lot of it has to do with we're, we're missing the simple stuff. And the simple stuff is important. So yes, you know, you can get the craziest complex surgery here. Uh, you can come see me for colonoscopies and I can take out polyps and possibly move cancers and you know, all these problems. But when it comes to, you know, the foundation for preventing some of these problems, uh, I think there's a lot of room for improvement in that space and you know, doctors play a role, uh, but there's a lot of stuff that can be done outside of the hospital and you know, the kitchen is just as important.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the kitchen is probably as important as the medicine cabinet.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, I just thank you so much for sharing that by the way. Ours is my, my second time, maybe third time hearing that story and it just gets better every time I hear it. He was like, I just get some nuggets out of it. So thank you so much for sharing that Dr Mcdonald and I think I echo exactly what you're setting and uh, and what this entire, you know, what does the entire concept of unconventional one of us is really centered around is still the patient provider relationship. There's still massive value in that. And I think that we both can say that we appreciate the fact that we live in a society where we do have major advancements in medical care. I mean, people are getting cured from different types of cancers all the time, all around the world. I mean, we might be on the cost of actually understanding.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, we now live in a world where we can treat hepatitis C, where we never. We never thought about that when I was going through PA school or medical school. Yeah. That was it. We were talking about, you know, these folks possibly having to go on the liver transplant list, but now we have a medication that could do it. So amen to the, to the advancements that we have in our medical care. But yes, some of those statistics that came out of the same conference that we attended was a, you know, it's unbelievable how 80 percent of Americans have a preventable disease. We don't die from tuberculosis anymore in this country, you know? Yeah. We'll get cases of it and stuff like that. But other, by and far these things have been treated and we thankfully have a society free of them. Um, but of that 80 percent of American, um, you know, depending upon, I guess the, the source that you're looking at.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen it as high as $2,000,000,000,000 in American medical costs to actually manage those 80 percent of Americans who have a preventable disease and so there's got to be. There's a problem here and I think that the biggest disconnect starts with the choices that we as the patients are actually making and so we need to empower our physicians, I think to let them understand that we want this and we need this and that. I don't care to be seen by a doctor, you know, many times throughout my entire year, I would love to come in, shake a hand, maybe have to do my colonoscopy when I'm 50 and you know, everything looks good. Mr Ritz, take care. Of, you know, I would love to. We would love for it to be like that, but you're absolutely right. I think that we are really losing touch with food. It's becoming far too easy for us to look at a way\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying, I just need this food. Maybe it is fast. We have a very fast food mentality and I'm not talking about just fast as restaurants. I think I'm talking about. We have this mentality that whole foods has made a massive market for themselves and they're a multibillion dollar corporation on the sense that yes, they sell good food, but the thing is, is that they also, you know, the reason why they were able to get people into the door was that they were taking their good food and then we're making it fast. So you could walk up and say, I want this, I want this, I want this. They'll put it into a tray and then you're out the door. So at least we're eating healthy foods. But yes, it's still a fast food mentality. So let me think about whole foods. We act like wholesome is a brand new concept, but if you go back to the 19 seventies, you know, 50, 60 years, etc.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every grocery store will hold on it. It, you know, there wasn't a whoLe, like most of the vegetables organic. Uh, if you went to the deli section, do you had, you know, people who really worked at a deli section mate fluid in the deli section. Um, so if anything, wholefoods is just returning to, you know, simpler day what we just focused on absolute. Well. And then one of the other talks that I remember that you had during your discussion with us at the conference was a, you know, these food swamps, food deserts, you know, and so if you wouldn't mind, could you describe a little bit about the food swamps in food desert concept for whiskers? Yeah. So, you know, food deserts, it's a term that really became popular and then they 2000 and it really describes neighborhoods where there is a lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, grocery stories that contain, you know, fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these neIghborhoods have convenience stores but not necessarily full fledged grocery stores. Uh, so those are basically call it food deserts. And the term actually originated in scotland and originate and United States. United states kind of took it and ran with it. Um, so chicago, a city in which I live in a definitely have some food deserts and most of the food desert is actually, uh, an african american neighborhood. It's not all of them are african american neighborhood. Okay. Uh, so food deserts do not affect everyone equally. However, allow retail areas, which they don't really get as much attention as he deserved. A, are also qualified as food deserts for different reasons. And so even though real areas may have farms and stuff like that, but, um, the fruit growing on those farms may not actually get to the residents of those areas and many places.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those area technically can, are considered food deserts, a food swamps, a little bit different concept. If anything, it's more of a realistic concept because one, if you go to any urban community has designated a food desert. It's not like you won't see food. Uh, there's plenty of food joints and you know, a plenty convenience stores. Uh, and so in many ways, those areas or swamp a swamp, unhealthy food and the food swamps, if anything, that's really driving a problem. Uh, you know, imagine if you're, if you don't have a whole lot of money, a hit, you're hungry. And when you're driving home from work or walking home from work or taking the train from home from work or just, you know, walking around the neighborhood in general and you pass, you know, your favorite barbecue spot or your favorite chicken joint or you know, mcdonald's or whatever, and you have to walk by all of these places. Uh, and these are places are the list of foods. It's not like the food taste better places and it's so easy and so tempting just to walk in there and get, you know, three wings for $2 or interference for us. And it's hard to, to be healthy in that scenario. I mean, it takes, like I, I hate to say everyone wants to talk aboUt willpower and self control and like I feel like these concepts are unfair to some degree because it's hard out here.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's all the time that we have for today's podcast.

It's time to put you in the driver's seat to be the force of change necessary for the lifestyle you've always wanted.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone. This is Frank from unconventional wellness radio and I have the special pleasure and privilege of being able to bring in my new friend Dr Edwin Mcdonald on the call today. Dr Edwin Mcdonald is a board certified gastroenterologist who teaches at the University of Chicago and he of course also sees patients there and he is also the associate director of human nutrition at the University of Chicago. And I had the great pleasure of meeting Dr Mcdonald a very recently, a matter of fact here in the Asheville area at the Healthy Eating in Conference Practice, uh, which was held by an organization called Asap, which is a great organization. It's a nonprofit trying to bring about awareness of sustainable agriculture. And they had this conference where they had folks who are just getting started with their medical careers. And then folks like Dr. Mcdonald has been practicing for a while, but they're doing very innovative and very cool things with the attrition and the bringing in all of these other aspects of wellness. And so Dr Mcdonald was a pleasure to have you on the call today.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, what's up, frank? And I'm honored to be here. Really appreciate everything that she's doing. So, uh, thanks for having me on the show, man.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. So one of the things that captivated us was your story that you, you're just a natural storyteller and I really want to share you with everybody out there in the, uh, the unconventional wellness world about just how brilliant is the journey has been for you leading up to your eventual deciding to go to medical school, but you really have this really great history of culinary arts. If you don't mind, why don't you go ahead and just kind of tell us a bit of that story of how you got started with that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So, you know, it's really interesting story about how I got into medicine. So, um, you know, originally what inspired me to get into medicine. Thanks. And my great grandfather who had never met before because he passed away before I was born, like before I was born. So I'm actually at when Mcdonald was for a, so I'm the fourth generation of men in my family with that name. And my son is assist. Uh, but my great grandfather was a actually a physician. Um, so we hear these stories about like how amazing this guy was. Um, and I have his name, but I never met him. Um, so I've always felt like I was, you know, living in that shadow. So he, uh, he was born in like 1893 or something like that. And his father was actually born a slave. Uh, so was born like before slavery ended.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just a baby at that time. Um, but my great grandfather ended up going to medical school at northwestern, which I didn't really know until I was actually a medical student at northwestern. Like I thought he went to medical school somewhere else and I literally found out when I was a medical student, coincidentally at northwestern. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, my great grandfather, it's funny, he was a pediatrician here in Chicago, so, uh, at that time African Americans can only go to certain hospitals. Do you know the way the world was that time? Of course, the unfortunate. Yeah. But that's, I mean, that was the reality of it. So, uh, he was a pediatrician in the hospital that was the only house in Chicago that was the African American and uh, as a result, a lot of my patients who are like in their nineties now actually his patients.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that right? Yeah. You never even knew that you were going to follow in his footsteps. And we actually have the same patient to some degree, but I have at least at least maybe 15 patients that had my great grandfather as their. Yeah. So I got into a, that's how I originally got interested in the medicine and um, subsequently, uh, you know, went to medical school and all that good stuff. But I got into nutrition primarily. It really started when I was younger. I always enjoy cooking from my grandmothers, taught me how to cook and everything. Uh, when I was younger, my mom was off in the hospital frequently, so I had to be the person that cooked for the family. So, uh, one of my grandmothers and, you know, these are like matriarchs of the family, so they really sat me, gave me cookbooks, you know, I'm like 10 years old, flipping through July of cooking, trying to find recipes for the family.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, I loved it. So I ended up with a halfway decent cook. And in fast forward to my teenage years, I started working at Mcdonald's and actually became a manager at McDonald's. So when I was working there, uh, I will see these families who will come in to Mcdonald's every day for dinner or some people come in every morning for breakfast. And I, you know, I just thought something was odd about that. Um, I don't really have the medical terminology to express what I thought was odd about it, but something just didn't seem right about people going to Mcdonald's every single day all the time, you know. So I started cooking thing. So then that wasn't on the menu. So I'll make omelets in the morning like you can't get, you know, Mcdonald's, but I would take the, the Canadian Bacon from the egg mcmuffins and the onions from the big Mac, uh, and the eggs from the egg mcmuffins and, you know, put them all on the skillet and own the grill and make omlettes.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05:54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and it got to the point where my Mcdonald's had a secret many became the iron chef at Mcdonald's there just for one, you shouldn't have. I should've put a 16 year old and anything. This is true and that's what you get. You get secret menu at Mcdonald's on the 16 year old is running the show. Uh, but, you know, for whatever reason, people enjoyed it. And uh, you know, seeing the fact that people enjoy what I was doing, a really showed me how important cooking was outside of my own home. You know, cooking for your family is one thing. But then when you start cooking for other people and really seeing how the positive impact that can have on somebody outside of people who actually like or no, you, uh, it's good. Uh, and that's something that I carried with you throughout Undergrad and subsequently in medical school.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I got into medical school, uh, you started learning about disease. Um, you know, for the most part in Undergrad and high school, you don't really learn about it disease and like what goes wrong with the human body and why. Uh, so even though I had this premed curriculum that was all science class, it wasn't actually learning about what happens to people and why, why things happen to people. So medical school was my first exposure to some of those concepts. And I remember being in some of those lectures sitting in front of the class and lectures would say, you know, we'll have a talk on diabetes. And they're like, well, diabetes, most of the reason why people have diabetes type two diabetes United States is because of the foods that we, uh, high blood pressure people in the United States eat too much sodium a heart disease. People eat foods that are too high in cholesterol. So I wouldn't raise my hand after all those lecturers and ask the lecturer, uh, well, what should we be eating? And uh, there will be a blank face, a blank stare on their face and no one would have a response. They will just say, well, we need right.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one would actually define with eating right was, um, and I would sit in the front of the class and a lot of these conditions disproportionately affect African Americans. And for me as an African American, you know, I'm asking the question not only as a position but also for myself, like I don't want to get diabetes for sure. Sure. I don't want to have high blood pressure. Uh, so, you know, there was definitely a desire to help others. But there was also, you know, I'm asking the question, how is self preservation to some degree? And no one would give me an answer and that effect, people will get annoyed. Like, why are you asking this question? So, you know, medical school, it didn't really, it just said these were the problem, but we didn't really learn about solutions. I mean, we learned about pharmacology. What medications the kids for high blood pressure.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can tell you a dozen medications for high blood pressure, but your average Dr probably couldn't tell you a dozen foods that can help with high blood pressure. Um, so that's something that, that carry on that I took when I went to a, become a resident and as a resident when I started having my own clinic, I had a clinic at the Jesse Brown VA where I had the privilege of taking care of veterans and like I told you at the conference and everyone at the conference, I really appreciate it taking care of that. Uh, if I had to pick out the one and one of the most important parts of my training, uh, probably my exposure to the veterans and, you know, being able to provide care for them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an amazing experience to be able to hang out with the World War II veterans, Korean War veterans and a Vietnam veterans. Most of the patients at that time with Vietnam veteran. And then, uh, at that time, uh, some of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, you know, I saw the first wave of people coming back. So, you know, people were able to share the experiences without what you're actually talking to one of those on the podcasts right now.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I was, I was a Iraq war veteran, so it's so know for me, uh, I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for the veterans. And then I also really appreciated hearing their stories and perspective because you know, what we see on the news and what really goes down. These aren't necessarily one and the same and you don't really know that until you have the opportunity to talk to somebody about that. So for me, you know, it was humbling. Uh, but I learned a lot and I didn't want that. If it's one of those experiences that you really. Well first of all we say you,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a veteran. We love our physicians and so if I tell you we thank you for your service as well and that uh, and that there really is like just value in hanging out with the veteran community because there's just so many stories like we come from all corners of the United States and to be able to descend what that common thread of curving, you know, and then just the networking that goes along with that is just changing. So, and\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a side note for you listeners, if you guys have any politicians that threatened to take funding away from the Va hospital and does not want to give va hospital needs, like those politicians are terrible and you should not support them. Uh, and you know, you can quote me on that and calling you versus Chicago Hospital and tell them, I said Mcdonald, you have to add an a to z so you'll still be able to find it. But yeah, no, thank you for that. So I had one veteran in particular and he talked about his story at the conference. So I'm a young intern. I have my clinic and I came into medicine with a certain degree of idealism. I'm very idealistic and I want to be this great doctor and I really want to help people and I see this patient for the first time, uh, I look over his chair, get his history and I see all the notes from other doctors and he had all the common diseases that affect Americans.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, had a mild stroke in the past, you know, mild heart attack and the path also had fatty liver disease is probably 100, 150 pounds overweight. And he also recently got divorced because he had erectile dysfunction. Uh, so with all the stuff he had gone on as far as health issues that lead to erectile dysfunction, which led to the divorce. And then plus, you know, he had some depression and you know, a whole bunch of things going on. And I lived through his chart. Every time we will come to the doctor, his blood pressure would be a little bit elevated. And when my colleague, which is add on another blood pressure medication or increase the dose blood pressure medication, if he came in, let's see, it could be a little bit higher and you know, every person, all they would do with that, another medication on our increased insulin and insulin actually promotes weight gain. So as his insulin, uh, as, as, as insulin builds with increasing his weight was simultaneously increasing with it. Um, he would have a heart attack, you know, they just give them aspirin or you will go from a baby aspirin to a full dose aspirin. And I was the response to heart attack, uh, if I may\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the workers for the benefit of the listeners. Dr McDonald, I wanted to let you guys know where there's a, there's a description is that I'm, I'm a, I'm a physician assistant. I didn't necessarily say that, but you guys probably know that to me, my other podcast. But that's something that we call it polypharmacy. And there's a way that a lot of Americans these days are being managed is that it's like if one blood pressure medication isn't working, there is a complimentary blood, my blood pressure medication that has been created, different class of medication, but then you ended up running into patients that are on five, six, seven medication to handle all these conditions that Dr Mcdonald was talking about. And then you can run into a slew of possible side effects that may or may not be going on. You know, like one of the most typical side effects with somebody like in the veterans community, the antidepressants is going to be erectile dysfunction and you have to watch out for some of the medications that folks are on commonly because a lot of folks just will tack these medications on. They do a quick little scrub, but then they're on five or six medications, which I don't know if anybody really likes to do that. But that's the concept of polypharmacy if that's okay. Then I ended that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh definitely, definitely. And then for me as a physician, I don't want to downplay the need for medication because in many situations people need medications, medications, and well study to, you know, have some positive benefits for absolutely scenarios, but when you use medications without addressing the underlying problem, um, I think it's like know, I don't want to say the elephant in the room, but for lack of a better analogy, like we're ignoring the obvious in certain situations in his situation. No one address what he was eating. And for me I felt like it was, there was obviously an issue or obviously something that we should talk about. But when I looked through all the notes, I didn't see any comment on what he was eating. I didn't see any, uh, you know, dietician though switching, unfortunately America, it's actually hard to sit down with a dietician, a.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most insurance companies don't pay for dieticians and Medicare, Medicaid, you know, good luck. You have to have really bad diabetes to be able to sit down with a Dietitian or um, and, and even still, they may not cover everything. Uh, so it's just like, why do you have to wait till you have diabetes in order to see a dietician? Like we should see Dietitians so we won't get diabetes. Right. That's a whole separate conversation. So I sat down and I asked them a simple question. I'm like, hey man, you know, so I see you have all these diseases that done from diet, like, what are you eating? And you just told me how and you know, I didn't think he meant hot dogs for every meal. So I asked them, I'm like, well, what are you doing for breakfast? And you know, he calmly said hot dogs.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I'm like, well, what are you doing for lunch? And he seemed a little bit, a little bit more annoyed. I could hear it in his voice a little bit, a little bit of anger and he's just like hot dogs. And then I asked them again, I'm like, okay, well what are you, what are you doing for dinner now? At this point I could tell he was visibly annoyed. Like he stood up, he looked like he was gonna walk out and I'm just like, listen, work with me man. And then he said hot dog again. Um, and so I realized he was really just eating hot dogs every single meal. Uh, and, and these weren't even hot dogs with relish on it. It was no festival whatsoever. It was just the hot dog and he didn't put ketchup on it. It was hot dogs and mustard because in Chicago, you know, Chicago style dog typically does not have ketchup on it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So he was just more of a southern thing I suppose. Yeah. I, you know, I should look up the history of that. But, uh, nonetheless, he was just eating hot dogs with mustard and, and I, you know, I told them, I'm like, you can't live on hot dogs. That is, that is not a life promoting dies, if anything that is a death promoting died show. And I realized we had to make some changes. So I gave them a recipe, a nothing fancy at that point in my life. And I knew how to cook what I wasn't a trained chef or anything like that. So I gave them a recipe. I just said, look man, what vegetables do you like? And he was just like, well, I love Broccoli, I love cauliflower. And I'm like, okay, cool. We can work with Broccoli. Um, I told him to basically just put some grass on cauliflower and Broccoli.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some olive oil on it, a little bit of salt, not too much because you have high blood pressure, a roasted and up and put it in for 25 roasted for 15, 20 minutes, get a little bit drawn and not too much. It'll come out the list. And he said, okay. I wrote down the recipe, we shook hands and I thought I'd come back and see me in three months. So three months later he comes back and I mean, he's like 40, 50 pounds down if he complained of dizziness because blood sugar was going low periodically. And also his blood pressure, uh, was a lot lower than what it has been a. So I'm looking at this guy, you know, I think the guy had cancer or something. I'm like, man, we need to check your prostate, like what was going on, did you get colonoscopy because she lost all this weight and I'm and I'm like, what have you been eating?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he basically was like, well, I stopped eating the hotdogs and I just ate the roasted vegetables. I'm like, well what's your this? And he wrote us lunch and you got a little bit of Noi roasted vegetables, dinner, the same thing. So he essentially switched over to a plant based diet and found that his blood pressure was low. Again, the blood sugar is on the low side. So we had to slowly decreases insulin. We had to slowly decreases blood pressure medication and you know, being on just Broccoli and cauliflower alone, that's not the healthiest diet to be on. And the longterm of. So we had the, you know, add some more plant based sources of protein and things of that nature and other, you know, variety of different vegetables. But know nonetheless, he switched over to becoming a vegetarian. And, you know, one thing that stood out that stood out to me, he said, when he lost all that weight, uh, he noticed that he can like his buddies, uh, whereas before, when he had so much weight on him, he couldn't really do that anymore.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost more weight, even mentioned that he had an easier time tying his shoes and put on his socks on. Whereas before, you know, he couldn't really put his socks on easy. Like it was a struggle. Uh, he had to have, you know, different tools to help him get his socks on and just, you know, simple things like being able to wipe himself easily and put it in the socks on, was his motivation to take things a step further. So, you know, he started riding his bike, he started, um, you know, walking more and started engaging in more physical activity. And, you know, subsequently as a result, he started feeling better. His depression got a little bit better. Uh, his erectile dysfunction got better. He started dating and you know, what I took away from that story was this was just all food, uh, this had nothing to do with me as a physician, you know, that there was no, uh, you know, it wasn't like a, I was, you know, the coaches it notre dam or something.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving them a great speech that inspired him. It wasn't like that. It was just, he just changed his diet and if anything he inspired me, uh, to, to talk about this with more patients because the change I saw him, I'm like, you know, can we replicate this? Can other people do what he did? Uh, and I found that yes, people can and people want to, um, we just have to give people the right guy to do that. Um, so that's why I decided eventually to after residency, a study nutrition and got to color in your school and get certified as a chef. So when I was doing my fellowship and nutrition at the newer Chicago, uh, that fellowship was mostly here towards clinical nutrition, which is very different than just talking about food. So clinical nutrition is really a, using a tpn and ivy nutrition, uh, and you know, placing feeding tubes and people's stomachs and stuff like that and feeding them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's really a sick population of patients. So these are people who've had severe injuries, uh, you know, be from trauma or car crashes and you know, a lot of their bowel has been removed so they can't include the regular way, uh, or people who have cancer and the cancer is blocking her bowels and we have to figure out ways to is to give them so they can survive, you know, as they're finishing chemotherapy. So a really sick population of patients. Uh, but then at fellowship wasn't teaching me about, you know, how to feed people who have diabetes. It wasn't talking about like everyday stuff. Uh, so that's, that's why I went to culinary arts school and in the evening and got trained as a chef and a, culinary arts training. Uh, you had to actually take a nutrition class. And the crazy thing is, you know, throughout medical school, I didn't have a nutrition class. I had to go to culinary arts school to get my first class and nutrition. Wow. And I went to a top notch medical school. I mean like one of the best in the country.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's crazy. But that, that's like the state of healthcare nowadays. And that also explains why, you know, we spend all this money on healthcare. We're the number one in the world when it comes to health spending. But in terms of, you know, our actual longevity, I think the United States where it's like 31st 33 in the world as far as how long were you actually living was there's a huge disconnect. Like we spend all this money but we don't necessarily get the outcome that we're paying for. So a lot of it has to do with we're, we're missing the simple stuff. And the simple stuff is important. So yes, you know, you can get the craziest complex surgery here. Uh, you can come see me for colonoscopies and I can take out polyps and possibly move cancers and you know, all these problems. But when it comes to, you know, the foundation for preventing some of these problems, uh, I think there's a lot of room for improvement in that space and you know, doctors play a role, uh, but there's a lot of stuff that can be done outside of the hospital and you know, the kitchen is just as important.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the kitchen is probably as important as the medicine cabinet.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, I just thank you so much for sharing that by the way. Ours is my, my second time, maybe third time hearing that story and it just gets better every time I hear it. He was like, I just get some nuggets out of it. So thank you so much for sharing that Dr Mcdonald and I think I echo exactly what you're setting and uh, and what this entire, you know, what does the entire concept of unconventional one of us is really centered around is still the patient provider relationship. There's still massive value in that. And I think that we both can say that we appreciate the fact that we live in a society where we do have major advancements in medical care. I mean, people are getting cured from different types of cancers all the time, all around the world. I mean, we might be on the cost of actually understanding.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24:56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, we now live in a world where we can treat hepatitis C, where we never. We never thought about that when I was going through PA school or medical school. Yeah. That was it. We were talking about, you know, these folks possibly having to go on the liver transplant list, but now we have a medication that could do it. So amen to the, to the advancements that we have in our medical care. But yes, some of those statistics that came out of the same conference that we attended was a, you know, it's unbelievable how 80 percent of Americans have a preventable disease. We don't die from tuberculosis anymore in this country, you know? Yeah. We'll get cases of it and stuff like that. But other, by and far these things have been treated and we thankfully have a society free of them. Um, but of that 80 percent of American, um, you know, depending upon, I guess the, the source that you're looking at.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen it as high as $2,000,000,000,000 in American medical costs to actually manage those 80 percent of Americans who have a preventable disease and so there's got to be. There's a problem here and I think that the biggest disconnect starts with the choices that we as the patients are actually making and so we need to empower our physicians, I think to let them understand that we want this and we need this and that. I don't care to be seen by a doctor, you know, many times throughout my entire year, I would love to come in, shake a hand, maybe have to do my colonoscopy when I'm 50 and you know, everything looks good. Mr Ritz, take care. Of, you know, I would love to. We would love for it to be like that, but you're absolutely right. I think that we are really losing touch with food. It's becoming far too easy for us to look at a way\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying, I just need this food. Maybe it is fast. We have a very fast food mentality and I'm not talking about just fast as restaurants. I think I'm talking about. We have this mentality that whole foods has made a massive market for themselves and they're a multibillion dollar corporation on the sense that yes, they sell good food, but the thing is, is that they also, you know, the reason why they were able to get people into the door was that they were taking their good food and then we're making it fast. So you could walk up and say, I want this, I want this, I want this. They'll put it into a tray and then you're out the door. So at least we're eating healthy foods. But yes, it's still a fast food mentality. So let me think about whole foods. We act like wholesome is a brand new concept, but if you go back to the 19 seventies, you know, 50, 60 years, etc.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every grocery store will hold on it. It, you know, there wasn't a whoLe, like most of the vegetables organic. Uh, if you went to the deli section, do you had, you know, people who really worked at a deli section mate fluid in the deli section. Um, so if anything, wholefoods is just returning to, you know, simpler day what we just focused on absolute. Well. And then one of the other talks that I remember that you had during your discussion with us at the conference was a, you know, these food swamps, food deserts, you know, and so if you wouldn't mind, could you describe a little bit about the food swamps in food desert concept for whiskers? Yeah. So, you know, food deserts, it's a term that really became popular and then they 2000 and it really describes neighborhoods where there is a lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, grocery stories that contain, you know, fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these neIghborhoods have convenience stores but not necessarily full fledged grocery stores. Uh, so those are basically call it food deserts. And the term actually originated in scotland and originate and United States. United states kind of took it and ran with it. Um, so chicago, a city in which I live in a definitely have some food deserts and most of the food desert is actually, uh, an african american neighborhood. It's not all of them are african american neighborhood. Okay. Uh, so food deserts do not affect everyone equally. However, allow retail areas, which they don't really get as much attention as he deserved. A, are also qualified as food deserts for different reasons. And so even though real areas may have farms and stuff like that, but, um, the fruit growing on those farms may not actually get to the residents of those areas and many places.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those area technically can, are considered food deserts, a food swamps, a little bit different concept. If anything, it's more of a realistic concept because one, if you go to any urban community has designated a food desert. It's not like you won't see food. Uh, there's plenty of food joints and you know, a plenty convenience stores. Uh, and so in many ways, those areas or swamp a swamp, unhealthy food and the food swamps, if anything, that's really driving a problem. Uh, you know, imagine if you're, if you don't have a whole lot of money, a hit, you're hungry. And when you're driving home from work or walking home from work or taking the train from home from work or just, you know, walking around the neighborhood in general and you pass, you know, your favorite barbecue spot or your favorite chicken joint or you know, mcdonald's or whatever, and you have to walk by all of these places. Uh, and these are places are the list of foods. It's not like the food taste better places and it's so easy and so tempting just to walk in there and get, you know, three wings for $2 or interference for us. And it's hard to, to be healthy in that scenario. I mean, it takes, like I, I hate to say everyone wants to talk aboUt willpower and self control and like I feel like these concepts are unfair to some degree because it's hard out here.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's all the time that we have for today's podcast.

And I had the great pleasure of meeting Dr Mcdonald a very recently, a matter of fact here in the Asheville area at the Healthy Eating in Conference Practice, uh, which was held by an organization called Asap, which is a great organization. It\\'s a nonprofit trying to bring about awareness of sustainable agriculture. And they had this conference where they had folks who are just getting started with their medical careers. And then folks like Dr. Mcdonald has been practicing for a while, but they\\'re doing very innovative and very cool things with the attrition and the bringing in all of these other aspects of wellness. And so Dr Mcdonald was a pleasure to have you on the call today.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=86.53\">01:26</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, what\\'s up, frank?

If you don\\'t mind, why don\\'t you go ahead and just kind of tell us a bit of that story of how you got started with that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=125.41\">02:05</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So, you know, it\\'s really interesting story about how I got into medicine. So, um, you know, originally what inspired me to get into medicine. Thanks. And my great grandfather who had never met before because he passed away before I was born, like before I was born. So I\\'m actually at when Mcdonald was for a, so I\\'m the fourth generation of men in my family with that name. And my son is assist. Uh, but my great grandfather was a actually a physician. Um, so we hear these stories about like how amazing this guy was. Um, and I have his name, but I never met him. Um, so I\\'ve always felt like I was, you know, living in that shadow. So he, uh, he was born in like 1893 or something like that. And his father was actually born a slave. Uh, so was born like before slavery ended.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=181.58\">03:01</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just a baby at that time. Um, but my great grandfather ended up going to medical school at northwestern, which I didn\\'t really know until I was actually a medical student at northwestern. Like I thought he went to medical school somewhere else and I literally found out when I was a medical student, coincidentally at northwestern. That\\'s all. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, my great grandfather, it\\'s funny, he was a pediatrician here in Chicago, so, uh, at that time African Americans can only go to certain hospitals. Do you know the way the world was that time? Of course, the unfortunate. Yeah. But that\\'s, I mean, that was the reality of it. So, uh, he was a pediatrician in the hospital that was the only house in Chicago that was the African American and uh, as a result, a lot of my patients who are like in their nineties now actually his patients.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=234.68\">03:54</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that right? Yeah. You never even knew that you were going to follow in his footsteps. And we actually have the same patient to some degree, but I have at least at least maybe 15 patients that had my great grandfather as their. Yeah. So I got into a, that\\'s how I originally got interested in the medicine and um, subsequently, uh, you know, went to medical school and all that good stuff. But I got into nutrition primarily. It really started when I was younger. I always enjoy cooking from my grandmothers, taught me how to cook and everything. Uh, when I was younger, my mom was off in the hospital frequently, so I had to be the person that cooked for the family. So, uh, one of my grandmothers and, you know, these are like matriarchs of the family, so they really sat me, gave me cookbooks, you know, I\\'m like 10 years old, flipping through July of cooking, trying to find recipes for the family.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=290.05\">04:50</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, I loved it. So I ended up with a halfway decent cook. And in fast forward to my teenage years, I started working at Mcdonald\\'s and actually became a manager at McDonald\\'s. So when I was working there, uh, I will see these families who will come in to Mcdonald\\'s every day for dinner or some people come in every morning for breakfast. And I, you know, I just thought something was odd about that. Um, I don\\'t really have the medical terminology to express what I thought was odd about it, but something just didn\\'t seem right about people going to Mcdonald\\'s every single day all the time, you know. So I started cooking thing. So then that wasn\\'t on the menu. So I\\'ll make omelets in the morning like you can\\'t get, you know, Mcdonald\\'s, but I would take the, the Canadian Bacon from the egg mcmuffins and the onions from the big Mac, uh, and the eggs from the egg mcmuffins and, you know, put them all on the skillet and own the grill and make omlettes.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=354.19\">05:54</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and it got to the point where my Mcdonald\\'s had a secret many became the iron chef at Mcdonald\\'s there just for one, you shouldn\\'t have. I should\\'ve put a 16 year old and anything. This is true and that\\'s what you get. You get secret menu at Mcdonald\\'s on the 16 year old is running the show. Uh, but, you know, for whatever reason, people enjoyed it. And uh, you know, seeing the fact that people enjoy what I was doing, a really showed me how important cooking was outside of my own home. You know, cooking for your family is one thing. But then when you start cooking for other people and really seeing how the positive impact that can have on somebody outside of people who actually like or no, you, uh, it\\'s good. Uh, and that\\'s something that I carried with you throughout Undergrad and subsequently in medical school.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=403.43\">06:43</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I got into medical school, uh, you started learning about disease. Um, you know, for the most part in Undergrad and high school, you don\\'t really learn about it disease and like what goes wrong with the human body and why. Uh, so even though I had this premed curriculum that was all science class, it wasn\\'t actually learning about what happens to people and why, why things happen to people. So medical school was my first exposure to some of those concepts. And I remember being in some of those lectures sitting in front of the class and lectures would say, you know, we\\'ll have a talk on diabetes. And they\\'re like, well, diabetes, most of the reason why people have diabetes type two diabetes United States is because of the foods that we, uh, high blood pressure people in the United States eat too much sodium a heart disease. People eat foods that are too high in cholesterol. So I wouldn\\'t raise my hand after all those lecturers and ask the lecturer, uh, well, what should we be eating? And uh, there will be a blank face, a blank stare on their face and no one would have a response. They will just say, well, we need right.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=475.46\">07:55</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one would actually define with eating right was, um, and I would sit in the front of the class and a lot of these conditions disproportionately affect African Americans. And for me as an African American, you know, I\\'m asking the question not only as a position but also for myself, like I don\\'t want to get diabetes for sure. Sure. I don\\'t want to have high blood pressure. Uh, so, you know, there was definitely a desire to help others. But there was also, you know, I\\'m asking the question, how is self preservation to some degree? And no one would give me an answer and that effect, people will get annoyed. Like, why are you asking this question? So, you know, medical school, it didn\\'t really, it just said these were the problem, but we didn\\'t really learn about solutions. I mean, we learned about pharmacology. What medications the kids for high blood pressure.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=529.79\">08:49</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can tell you a dozen medications for high blood pressure, but your average Dr probably couldn\\'t tell you a dozen foods that can help with high blood pressure. Um, so that\\'s something that, that carry on that I took when I went to a, become a resident and as a resident when I started having my own clinic, I had a clinic at the Jesse Brown VA where I had the privilege of taking care of veterans and like I told you at the conference and everyone at the conference, I really appreciate it taking care of that. Uh, if I had to pick out the one and one of the most important parts of my training, uh, probably my exposure to the veterans and, you know, being able to provide care for them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=573.69\">09:33</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an amazing experience to be able to hang out with the World War II veterans, Korean War veterans and a Vietnam veterans. Most of the patients at that time with Vietnam veteran. And then, uh, at that time, uh, some of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, you know, I saw the first wave of people coming back. So, you know, people were able to share the experiences without what you\\'re actually talking to one of those on the podcasts right now.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=600.48\">10:00</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I was, I was a Iraq war veteran, so it\\'s so know for me, uh, I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for the veterans. And then I also really appreciated hearing their stories and perspective because you know, what we see on the news and what really goes down. These aren\\'t necessarily one and the same and you don\\'t really know that until you have the opportunity to talk to somebody about that. So for me, you know, it was humbling. Uh, but I learned a lot and I didn\\'t want that. If it\\'s one of those experiences that you really. Well first of all we say you,\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=637.68\">10:37</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a veteran. We love our physicians and so if I tell you we thank you for your service as well and that uh, and that there really is like just value in hanging out with the veteran community because there\\'s just so many stories like we come from all corners of the United States and to be able to descend what that common thread of curving, you know, and then just the networking that goes along with that is just changing.

Uh, and you know, you can quote me on that and calling you versus Chicago Hospital and tell them, I said Mcdonald, you have to add an a to z so you\\'ll still be able to find it. But yeah, no, thank you for that. So I had one veteran in particular and he talked about his story at the conference. So I\\'m a young intern. I have my clinic and I came into medicine with a certain degree of idealism. I\\'m very idealistic and I want to be this great doctor and I really want to help people and I see this patient for the first time, uh, I look over his chair, get his history and I see all the notes from other doctors and he had all the common diseases that affect Americans.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=725.9\">12:05</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, had a mild stroke in the past, you know, mild heart attack and the path also had fatty liver disease is probably 100, 150 pounds overweight. And he also recently got divorced because he had erectile dysfunction. Uh, so with all the stuff he had gone on as far as health issues that lead to erectile dysfunction, which led to the divorce. And then plus, you know, he had some depression and you know, a whole bunch of things going on. And I lived through his chart. Every time we will come to the doctor, his blood pressure would be a little bit elevated. And when my colleague, which is add on another blood pressure medication or increase the dose blood pressure medication, if he came in, let\\'s see, it could be a little bit higher and you know, every person, all they would do with that, another medication on our increased insulin and insulin actually promotes weight gain. So as his insulin, uh, as, as, as insulin builds with increasing his weight was simultaneously increasing with it.

Dr McDonald, I wanted to let you guys know where there\\'s a, there\\'s a description is that I\\'m, I\\'m a, I\\'m a physician assistant. I didn\\'t necessarily say that, but you guys probably know that to me, my other podcast. But that\\'s something that we call it polypharmacy. And there\\'s a way that a lot of Americans these days are being managed is that it\\'s like if one blood pressure medication isn\\'t working, there is a complimentary blood, my blood pressure medication that has been created, different class of medication, but then you ended up running into patients that are on five, six, seven medication to handle all these conditions that Dr Mcdonald was talking about. And then you can run into a slew of possible side effects that may or may not be going on. You know, like one of the most typical side effects with somebody like in the veterans community, the antidepressants is going to be erectile dysfunction and you have to watch out for some of the medications that folks are on commonly because a lot of folks just will tack these medications on. They do a quick little scrub, but then they\\'re on five or six medications, which I don\\'t know if anybody really likes to do that. But that\\'s the concept of polypharmacy if that\\'s okay. Then I ended that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=870.22\">14:30</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh definitely, definitely. And then for me as a physician, I don\\'t want to downplay the need for medication because in many situations people need medications, medications, and well study to, you know, have some positive benefits for absolutely scenarios, but when you use medications without addressing the underlying problem, um, I think it\\'s like know, I don\\'t want to say the elephant in the room, but for lack of a better analogy, like we\\'re ignoring the obvious in certain situations in his situation. No one address what he was eating. And for me I felt like it was, there was obviously an issue or obviously something that we should talk about. But when I looked through all the notes, I didn\\'t see any comment on what he was eating. I didn\\'t see any, uh, you know, dietician though switching, unfortunately America, it\\'s actually hard to sit down with a dietician, a.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=922.85\">15:22</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most insurance companies don\\'t pay for dieticians and Medicare, Medicaid, you know, good luck. You have to have really bad diabetes to be able to sit down with a Dietitian or um, and, and even still, they may not cover everything. Uh, so it\\'s just like, why do you have to wait till you have diabetes in order to see a dietician? Like we should see Dietitians so we won\\'t get diabetes. Right. That\\'s a whole separate conversation. So I sat down and I asked them a simple question. I\\'m like, hey man, you know, so I see you have all these diseases that done from diet, like, what are you eating? And you just told me how and you know, I didn\\'t think he meant hot dogs for every meal. So I asked them, I\\'m like, well, what are you doing for breakfast? And you know, he calmly said hot dogs.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=973.73\">16:13</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I\\'m like, well, what are you doing for lunch? And he seemed a little bit, a little bit more annoyed. I could hear it in his voice a little bit, a little bit of anger and he\\'s just like hot dogs. And then I asked them again, I\\'m like, okay, well what are you, what are you doing for dinner now? At this point I could tell he was visibly annoyed. Like he stood up, he looked like he was gonna walk out and I\\'m just like, listen, work with me man. And then he said hot dog again. Um, and so I realized he was really just eating hot dogs every single meal. Uh, and, and these weren\\'t even hot dogs with relish on it. It was no festival whatsoever. It was just the hot dog and he didn\\'t put ketchup on it. It was hot dogs and mustard because in Chicago, you know, Chicago style dog typically does not have ketchup on it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1023.36\">17:03</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So he was just more of a southern thing I suppose. Yeah. I, you know, I should look up the history of that. But, uh, nonetheless, he was just eating hot dogs with mustard and, and I, you know, I told them, I\\'m like, you can\\'t live on hot dogs. That is, that is not a life promoting dies, if anything that is a death promoting died show. And I realized we had to make some changes. So I gave them a recipe, a nothing fancy at that point in my life. And I knew how to cook what I wasn\\'t a trained chef or anything like that. So I gave them a recipe. I just said, look man, what vegetables do you like? And he was just like, well, I love Broccoli, I love cauliflower. And I\\'m like, okay, cool. We can work with Broccoli. Um, I told him to basically just put some grass on cauliflower and Broccoli.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1077.29\">17:57</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some olive oil on it, a little bit of salt, not too much because you have high blood pressure, a roasted and up and put it in for 25 roasted for 15, 20 minutes, get a little bit drawn and not too much. It\\'ll come out the list. And he said, okay. I wrote down the recipe, we shook hands and I thought I\\'d come back and see me in three months. So three months later he comes back and I mean, he\\'s like 40, 50 pounds down if he complained of dizziness because blood sugar was going low periodically. And also his blood pressure, uh, was a lot lower than what it has been a. So I\\'m looking at this guy, you know, I think the guy had cancer or something. I\\'m like, man, we need to check your prostate, like what was going on, did you get colonoscopy because she lost all this weight and I\\'m and I\\'m like, what have you been eating?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1128.74\">18:48</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he basically was like, well, I stopped eating the hotdogs and I just ate the roasted vegetables. I\\'m like, well what\\'s your this? And he wrote us lunch and you got a little bit of Noi roasted vegetables, dinner, the same thing. So he essentially switched over to a plant based diet and found that his blood pressure was low. Again, the blood sugar is on the low side. So we had to slowly decreases insulin. We had to slowly decreases blood pressure medication and you know, being on just Broccoli and cauliflower alone, that\\'s not the healthiest diet to be on. And the longterm of. So we had the, you know, add some more plant based sources of protein and things of that nature and other, you know, variety of different vegetables. But know nonetheless, he switched over to becoming a vegetarian. And, you know, one thing that stood out that stood out to me, he said, when he lost all that weight, uh, he noticed that he can like his buddies, uh, whereas before, when he had so much weight on him, he couldn\\'t really do that anymore.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1191.96\">19:51</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost more weight, even mentioned that he had an easier time tying his shoes and put on his socks on. Whereas before, you know, he couldn\\'t really put his socks on easy. Like it was a struggle. Uh, he had to have, you know, different tools to help him get his socks on and just, you know, simple things like being able to wipe himself easily and put it in the socks on, was his motivation to take things a step further. So, you know, he started riding his bike, he started, um, you know, walking more and started engaging in more physical activity. And, you know, subsequently as a result, he started feeling better. His depression got a little bit better. Uh, his erectile dysfunction got better. He started dating and you know, what I took away from that story was this was just all food, uh, this had nothing to do with me as a physician, you know, that there was no, uh, you know, it wasn\\'t like a, I was, you know, the coaches it notre dam or something.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1250.38\">20:50</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\\'m giving them a great speech that inspired him. It wasn\\'t like that. It was just, he just changed his diet and if anything he inspired me, uh, to, to talk about this with more patients because the change I saw him, I\\'m like, you know, can we replicate this? Can other people do what he did? Uh, and I found that yes, people can and people want to, um, we just have to give people the right guy to do that. Um, so that\\'s why I decided eventually to after residency, a study nutrition and got to color in your school and get certified as a chef. So when I was doing my fellowship and nutrition at the newer Chicago, uh, that fellowship was mostly here towards clinical nutrition, which is very different than just talking about food. So clinical nutrition is really a, using a tpn and ivy nutrition, uh, and you know, placing feeding tubes and people\\'s stomachs and stuff like that and feeding them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1312.96\">21:52</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it\\'s really a sick population of patients. So these are people who\\'ve had severe injuries, uh, you know, be from trauma or car crashes and you know, a lot of their bowel has been removed so they can\\'t include the regular way, uh, or people who have cancer and the cancer is blocking her bowels and we have to figure out ways to is to give them so they can survive, you know, as they\\'re finishing chemotherapy. So a really sick population of patients. Uh, but then at fellowship wasn\\'t teaching me about, you know, how to feed people who have diabetes. It wasn\\'t talking about like everyday stuff. Uh, so that\\'s, that\\'s why I went to culinary arts school and in the evening and got trained as a chef and a, culinary arts training. Uh, you had to actually take a nutrition class. And the crazy thing is, you know, throughout medical school, I didn\\'t have a nutrition class. I had to go to culinary arts school to get my first class and nutrition. Wow. And I went to a top notch medical school. I mean like one of the best in the country.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1375.15\">22:55</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that\\'s crazy. But that, that\\'s like the state of healthcare nowadays. And that also explains why, you know, we spend all this money on healthcare. We\\'re the number one in the world when it comes to health spending. But in terms of, you know, our actual longevity, I think the United States where it\\'s like 31st 33 in the world as far as how long were you actually living was there\\'s a huge disconnect. Like we spend all this money but we don\\'t necessarily get the outcome that we\\'re paying for. So a lot of it has to do with we\\'re, we\\'re missing the simple stuff. And the simple stuff is important. So yes, you know, you can get the craziest complex surgery here. Uh, you can come see me for colonoscopies and I can take out polyps and possibly move cancers and you know, all these problems. But when it comes to, you know, the foundation for preventing some of these problems, uh, I think there\\'s a lot of room for improvement in that space and you know, doctors play a role, uh, but there\\'s a lot of stuff that can be done outside of the hospital and you know, the kitchen is just as important.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1442.7\">24:02</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the kitchen is probably as important as the medicine cabinet.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1447.52\">24:07</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, I just thank you so much for sharing that by the way. Ours is my, my second time, maybe third time hearing that story and it just gets better every time I hear it. He was like, I just get some nuggets out of it. So thank you so much for sharing that Dr Mcdonald and I think I echo exactly what you\\'re setting and uh, and what this entire, you know, what does the entire concept of unconventional one of us is really centered around is still the patient provider relationship. There\\'s still massive value in that. And I think that we both can say that we appreciate the fact that we live in a society where we do have major advancements in medical care. I mean, people are getting cured from different types of cancers all the time, all around the world. I mean, we might be on the cost of actually understanding.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1496.93\">24:56</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, we now live in a world where we can treat hepatitis C, where we never. We never thought about that when I was going through PA school or medical school. Yeah. That was it. We were talking about, you know, these folks possibly having to go on the liver transplant list, but now we have a medication that could do it. So amen to the, to the advancements that we have in our medical care. But yes, some of those statistics that came out of the same conference that we attended was a, you know, it\\'s unbelievable how 80 percent of Americans have a preventable disease. We don\\'t die from tuberculosis anymore in this country, you know? Yeah. We\\'ll get cases of it and stuff like that. But other, by and far these things have been treated and we thankfully have a society free of them. Um, but of that 80 percent of American, um, you know, depending upon, I guess the, the source that you\\'re looking at.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1549.19\">25:49</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\\'ve seen it as high as $2,000,000,000,000 in American medical costs to actually manage those 80 percent of Americans who have a preventable disease and so there\\'s got to be. There\\'s a problem here and I think that the biggest disconnect starts with the choices that we as the patients are actually making and so we need to empower our physicians, I think to let them understand that we want this and we need this and that. I don\\'t care to be seen by a doctor, you know, many times throughout my entire year, I would love to come in, shake a hand, maybe have to do my colonoscopy when I\\'m 50 and you know, everything looks good. Mr Ritz, take care. Of, you know, I would love to. We would love for it to be like that, but you\\'re absolutely right. I think that we are really losing touch with food. It\\'s becoming far too easy for us to look at a way\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1604.88\">26:44</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying, I just need this food. Maybe it is fast. We have a very fast food mentality and I\\'m not talking about just fast as restaurants. I think I\\'m talking about. We have this mentality that whole foods has made a massive market for themselves and they\\'re a multibillion dollar corporation on the sense that yes, they sell good food, but the thing is, is that they also, you know, the reason why they were able to get people into the door was that they were taking their good food and then we\\'re making it fast. So you could walk up and say, I want this, I want this, I want this. They\\'ll put it into a tray and then you\\'re out the door. So at least we\\'re eating healthy foods. But yes, it\\'s still a fast food mentality. So let me think about whole foods. We act like wholesome is a brand new concept, but if you go back to the 19 seventies, you know, 50, 60 years, etc.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1652.16\">27:32</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every grocery store will hold on it. It, you know, there wasn\\'t a whoLe, like most of the vegetables organic. Uh, if you went to the deli section, do you had, you know, people who really worked at a deli section mate fluid in the deli section. Um, so if anything, wholefoods is just returning to, you know, simpler day what we just focused on absolute. Well. And then one of the other talks that I remember that you had during your discussion with us at the conference was a, you know, these food swamps, food deserts, you know, and so if you wouldn\\'t mind, could you describe a little bit about the food swamps in food desert concept for whiskers? Yeah. So, you know, food deserts, it\\'s a term that really became popular and then they 2000 and it really describes neighborhoods where there is a lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, grocery stories that contain, you know, fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1708.14\">28:28</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these neIghborhoods have convenience stores but not necessarily full fledged grocery stores. Uh, so those are basically call it food deserts. And the term actually originated in scotland and originate and United States. United states kind of took it and ran with it. Um, so chicago, a city in which I live in a definitely have some food deserts and most of the food desert is actually, uh, an african american neighborhood. It\\'s not all of them are african american neighborhood. Okay. Uh, so food deserts do not affect everyone equally. However, allow retail areas, which they don\\'t really get as much attention as he deserved. A, are also qualified as food deserts for different reasons. And so even though real areas may have farms and stuff like that, but, um, the fruit growing on those farms may not actually get to the residents of those areas and many places.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1762.14\">29:22</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those area technically can, are considered food deserts, a food swamps, a little bit different concept. If anything, it\\'s more of a realistic concept because one, if you go to any urban community has designated a food desert. It\\'s not like you won\\'t see food. Uh, there\\'s plenty of food joints and you know, a plenty convenience stores. Uh, and so in many ways, those areas or swamp a swamp, unhealthy food and the food swamps, if anything, that\\'s really driving a problem. Uh, you know, imagine if you\\'re, if you don\\'t have a whole lot of money, a hit, you\\'re hungry. And when you\\'re driving home from work or walking home from work or taking the train from home from work or just, you know, walking around the neighborhood in general and you pass, you know, your favorite barbecue spot or your favorite chicken joint or you know, mcdonald\\'s or whatever, and you have to walk by all of these places. Uh, and these are places are the list of foods. It\\'s not like the food taste better places and it\\'s so easy and so tempting just to walk in there and get, you know, three wings for $2 or interference for us. And it\\'s hard to, to be healthy in that scenario. I mean, it takes, like I, I hate to say everyone wants to talk aboUt willpower and self control and like I feel like these concepts are unfair to some degree because it\\'s hard out here.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1858.09\">30:58</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that\\'s all the time that we have for today\\'s podcast.

Dr Edwin Mcdonald is a board certified gastroenterologist who teaches at the University of Chicago and he of course also sees patients there and he is also the associate director of human nutrition at the University of Chicago. And I had the great pleasure of meeting Dr Mcdonald a very recently, a matter of fact here in the Asheville area at the Healthy Eating in Conference Practice, uh, which was held by an organization called Asap, which is a great organization. It\\'s a nonprofit trying to bring about awareness of sustainable agriculture. And they had this conference where they had folks who are just getting started with their medical careers. And then folks like Dr. Mcdonald has been practicing for a while, but they\\'re doing very innovative and very cool things with the attrition and the bringing in all of these other aspects of wellness.

So, you know, it\\'s really interesting story about how I got into medicine. So, um, you know, originally what inspired me to get into medicine. Thanks. And my great grandfather who had never met before because he passed away before I was born, like before I was born. So I\\'m actually at when Mcdonald was for a, so I\\'m the fourth generation of men in my family with that name. And my son is assist. Uh, but my great grandfather was a actually a physician. Um, so we hear these stories about like how amazing this guy was. Um, and I have his name, but I never met him. Um, so I\\'ve always felt like I was, you know, living in that shadow. So he, uh, he was born in like 1893 or something like that. And his father was actually born a slave.

Like I thought he went to medical school somewhere else and I literally found out when I was a medical student, coincidentally at northwestern. That\\'s all. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, my great grandfather, it\\'s funny, he was a pediatrician here in Chicago, so, uh, at that time African Americans can only go to certain hospitals. Do you know the way the world was that time? Of course, the unfortunate. Yeah. But that\\'s, I mean, that was the reality of it. So, uh, he was a pediatrician in the hospital that was the only house in Chicago that was the African American and uh, as a result, a lot of my patients who are like in their nineties now actually his patients.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=234.68\">03:54</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that right? Yeah. You never even knew that you were going to follow in his footsteps. And we actually have the same patient to some degree, but I have at least at least maybe 15 patients that had my great grandfather as their. Yeah. So I got into a, that\\'s how I originally got interested in the medicine and um, subsequently, uh, you know, went to medical school and all that good stuff. But I got into nutrition primarily. It really started when I was younger. I always enjoy cooking from my grandmothers, taught me how to cook and everything. Uh, when I was younger, my mom was off in the hospital frequently, so I had to be the person that cooked for the family. So, uh, one of my grandmothers and, you know, these are like matriarchs of the family, so they really sat me, gave me cookbooks, you know, I\\'m like 10 years old, flipping through July of cooking, trying to find recipes for the family.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=290.05\">04:50</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And uh, I loved it. So I ended up with a halfway decent cook. And in fast forward to my teenage years, I started working at Mcdonald\\'s and actually became a manager at McDonald\\'s. So when I was working there, uh, I will see these families who will come in to Mcdonald\\'s every day for dinner or some people come in every morning for breakfast. And I, you know, I just thought something was odd about that. Um, I don\\'t really have the medical terminology to express what I thought was odd about it, but something just didn\\'t seem right about people going to Mcdonald\\'s every single day all the time, you know. So I started cooking thing. So then that wasn\\'t on the menu. So I\\'ll make omelets in the morning like you can\\'t get, you know, Mcdonald\\'s, but I would take the, the Canadian Bacon from the egg mcmuffins and the onions from the big Mac, uh, and the eggs from the egg mcmuffins and, you know, put them all on the skillet and own the grill and make omlettes.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=354.19\">05:54</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and it got to the point where my Mcdonald\\'s had a secret many became the iron chef at Mcdonald\\'s there just for one, you shouldn\\'t have. I should\\'ve put a 16 year old and anything. This is true and that\\'s what you get. You get secret menu at Mcdonald\\'s on the 16 year old is running the show. Uh, but, you know, for whatever reason, people enjoyed it. And uh, you know, seeing the fact that people enjoy what I was doing, a really showed me how important cooking was outside of my own home. You know, cooking for your family is one thing. But then when you start cooking for other people and really seeing how the positive impact that can have on somebody outside of people who actually like or no, you, uh, it\\'s good.

Um, you know, for the most part in Undergrad and high school, you don\\'t really learn about it disease and like what goes wrong with the human body and why. Uh, so even though I had this premed curriculum that was all science class, it wasn\\'t actually learning about what happens to people and why, why things happen to people. So medical school was my first exposure to some of those concepts. And I remember being in some of those lectures sitting in front of the class and lectures would say, you know, we\\'ll have a talk on diabetes. And they\\'re like, well, diabetes, most of the reason why people have diabetes type two diabetes United States is because of the foods that we, uh, high blood pressure people in the United States eat too much sodium a heart disease. People eat foods that are too high in cholesterol. So I wouldn\\'t raise my hand after all those lecturers and ask the lecturer, uh, well, what should we be eating? And uh, there will be a blank face, a blank stare on their face and no one would have a response. They will just say, well, we need right.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=475.46\">07:55</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one would actually define with eating right was, um, and I would sit in the front of the class and a lot of these conditions disproportionately affect African Americans. And for me as an African American, you know, I\\'m asking the question not only as a position but also for myself, like I don\\'t want to get diabetes for sure. Sure. I don\\'t want to have high blood pressure. Uh, so, you know, there was definitely a desire to help others. But there was also, you know, I\\'m asking the question, how is self preservation to some degree? And no one would give me an answer and that effect, people will get annoyed. Like, why are you asking this question? So, you know, medical school, it didn\\'t really, it just said these were the problem, but we didn\\'t really learn about solutions. I mean, we learned about pharmacology. What medications the kids for high blood pressure.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=529.79\">08:49</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can tell you a dozen medications for high blood pressure, but your average Dr probably couldn\\'t tell you a dozen foods that can help with high blood pressure. Um, so that\\'s something that, that carry on that I took when I went to a, become a resident and as a resident when I started having my own clinic, I had a clinic at the Jesse Brown VA where I had the privilege of taking care of veterans and like I told you at the conference and everyone at the conference, I really appreciate it taking care of that.

And then I also really appreciated hearing their stories and perspective because you know, what we see on the news and what really goes down. These aren\\'t necessarily one and the same and you don\\'t really know that until you have the opportunity to talk to somebody about that. So for me, you know, it was humbling.

Uh, and you know, you can quote me on that and calling you versus Chicago Hospital and tell them, I said Mcdonald, you have to add an a to z so you\\'ll still be able to find it. But yeah, no, thank you for that. So I had one veteran in particular and he talked about his story at the conference. So I\\'m a young intern. I have my clinic and I came into medicine with a certain degree of idealism. I\\'m very idealistic and I want to be this great doctor and I really want to help people and I see this patient for the first time, uh, I look over his chair, get his history and I see all the notes from other doctors and he had all the common diseases that affect Americans.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=725.9\">12:05</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, so diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, had a mild stroke in the past, you know, mild heart attack and the path also had fatty liver disease is probably 100, 150 pounds overweight. And he also recently got divorced because he had erectile dysfunction. Uh, so with all the stuff he had gone on as far as health issues that lead to erectile dysfunction, which led to the divorce. And then plus, you know, he had some depression and you know, a whole bunch of things going on. And I lived through his chart. Every time we will come to the doctor, his blood pressure would be a little bit elevated. And when my colleague, which is add on another blood pressure medication or increase the dose blood pressure medication, if he came in, let\\'s see, it could be a little bit higher and you know, every person, all they would do with that, another medication on our increased insulin and insulin actually promotes weight gain. So as his insulin, uh, as, as, as insulin builds with increasing his weight was simultaneously increasing with it.

Dr McDonald, I wanted to let you guys know where there\\'s a, there\\'s a description is that I\\'m, I\\'m a, I\\'m a physician assistant. I didn\\'t necessarily say that, but you guys probably know that to me, my other podcast. But that\\'s something that we call it polypharmacy. And there\\'s a way that a lot of Americans these days are being managed is that it\\'s like if one blood pressure medication isn\\'t working, there is a complimentary blood, my blood pressure medication that has been created, different class of medication, but then you ended up running into patients that are on five, six, seven medication to handle all these conditions that Dr Mcdonald was talking about. And then you can run into a slew of possible side effects that may or may not be going on. You know, like one of the most typical side effects with somebody like in the veterans community, the antidepressants is going to be erectile dysfunction and you have to watch out for some of the medications that folks are on commonly because a lot of folks just will tack these medications on. They do a quick little scrub, but then they\\'re on five or six medications, which I don\\'t know if anybody really likes to do that. But that\\'s the concept of polypharmacy if that\\'s okay. Then I ended that.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=870.22\">14:30</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh definitely, definitely. And then for me as a physician, I don\\'t want to downplay the need for medication because in many situations people need medications, medications, and well study to, you know, have some positive benefits for absolutely scenarios, but when you use medications without addressing the underlying problem, um, I think it\\'s like know, I don\\'t want to say the elephant in the room, but for lack of a better analogy, like we\\'re ignoring the obvious in certain situations in his situation. No one address what he was eating. And for me I felt like it was, there was obviously an issue or obviously something that we should talk about. But when I looked through all the notes, I didn\\'t see any comment on what he was eating. I didn\\'t see any, uh, you know, dietician though switching, unfortunately America, it\\'s actually hard to sit down with a dietician, a.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=922.85\">15:22</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most insurance companies don\\'t pay for dieticians and Medicare, Medicaid, you know, good luck. You have to have really bad diabetes to be able to sit down with a Dietitian or um, and, and even still, they may not cover everything. Uh, so it\\'s just like, why do you have to wait till you have diabetes in order to see a dietician? Like we should see Dietitians so we won\\'t get diabetes. Right. That\\'s a whole separate conversation. So I sat down and I asked them a simple question. I\\'m like, hey man, you know, so I see you have all these diseases that done from diet, like, what are you eating? And you just told me how and you know, I didn\\'t think he meant hot dogs for every meal. So I asked them, I\\'m like, well, what are you doing for breakfast? And you know, he calmly said hot dogs.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=973.73\">16:13</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I\\'m like, well, what are you doing for lunch? And he seemed a little bit, a little bit more annoyed. I could hear it in his voice a little bit, a little bit of anger and he\\'s just like hot dogs. And then I asked them again, I\\'m like, okay, well what are you, what are you doing for dinner now? At this point I could tell he was visibly annoyed. Like he stood up, he looked like he was gonna walk out and I\\'m just like, listen, work with me man. And then he said hot dog again. Um, and so I realized he was really just eating hot dogs every single meal. Uh, and, and these weren\\'t even hot dogs with relish on it. It was no festival whatsoever. It was just the hot dog and he didn\\'t put ketchup on it. It was hot dogs and mustard because in Chicago, you know, Chicago style dog typically does not have ketchup on it.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1023.36\">17:03</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So he was just more of a southern thing I suppose. Yeah. I, you know, I should look up the history of that. But, uh, nonetheless, he was just eating hot dogs with mustard and, and I, you know, I told them, I\\'m like, you can\\'t live on hot dogs. That is, that is not a life promoting dies, if anything that is a death promoting died show. And I realized we had to make some changes. So I gave them a recipe, a nothing fancy at that point in my life. And I knew how to cook what I wasn\\'t a trained chef or anything like that. So I gave them a recipe. I just said, look man, what vegetables do you like? And he was just like, well, I love Broccoli, I love cauliflower. And I\\'m like, okay, cool. We can work with Broccoli. Um, I told him to basically just put some grass on cauliflower and Broccoli.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1077.29\">17:57</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some olive oil on it, a little bit of salt, not too much because you have high blood pressure, a roasted and up and put it in for 25 roasted for 15, 20 minutes, get a little bit drawn and not too much. It\\'ll come out the list. And he said, okay. I wrote down the recipe, we shook hands and I thought I\\'d come back and see me in three months. So three months later he comes back and I mean, he\\'s like 40, 50 pounds down if he complained of dizziness because blood sugar was going low periodically. And also his blood pressure, uh, was a lot lower than what it has been a. So I\\'m looking at this guy, you know, I think the guy had cancer or something. I\\'m like, man, we need to check your prostate, like what was going on, did you get colonoscopy because she lost all this weight and I\\'m and I\\'m like, what have you been eating?\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1128.74\">18:48</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he basically was like, well, I stopped eating the hotdogs and I just ate the roasted vegetables. I\\'m like, well what\\'s your this? And he wrote us lunch and you got a little bit of Noi roasted vegetables, dinner, the same thing. So he essentially switched over to a plant based diet and found that his blood pressure was low. Again, the blood sugar is on the low side. So we had to slowly decreases insulin. We had to slowly decreases blood pressure medication and you know, being on just Broccoli and cauliflower alone, that\\'s not the healthiest diet to be on. And the longterm of. So we had the, you know, add some more plant based sources of protein and things of that nature and other, you know, variety of different vegetables. But know nonetheless, he switched over to becoming a vegetarian. And, you know, one thing that stood out that stood out to me, he said, when he lost all that weight, uh, he noticed that he can like his buddies, uh, whereas before, when he had so much weight on him, he couldn\\'t really do that anymore.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1191.96\">19:51</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost more weight, even mentioned that he had an easier time tying his shoes and put on his socks on. Whereas before, you know, he couldn\\'t really put his socks on easy. Like it was a struggle. Uh, he had to have, you know, different tools to help him get his socks on and just, you know, simple things like being able to wipe himself easily and put it in the socks on, was his motivation to take things a step further. So, you know, he started riding his bike, he started, um, you know, walking more and started engaging in more physical activity. And, you know, subsequently as a result, he started feeling better. His depression got a little bit better. Uh, his erectile dysfunction got better. He started dating and you know, what I took away from that story was this was just all food, uh, this had nothing to do with me as a physician, you know, that there was no, uh, you know, it wasn\\'t like a, I was, you know, the coaches it notre dam or something.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1250.38\">20:50</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\\'m giving them a great speech that inspired him. It wasn\\'t like that.

Can other people do what he did? Uh, and I found that yes, people can and people want to, um, we just have to give people the right guy to do that. Um, so that\\'s why I decided eventually to after residency, a study nutrition and got to color in your school and get certified as a chef. So when I was doing my fellowship and nutrition at the newer Chicago, uh, that fellowship was mostly here towards clinical nutrition, which is very different than just talking about food. So clinical nutrition is really a, using a tpn and ivy nutrition, uh, and you know, placing feeding tubes and people\\'s stomachs and stuff like that and feeding them.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1312.96\">21:52</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it\\'s really a sick population of patients. So these are people who\\'ve had severe injuries, uh, you know, be from trauma or car crashes and you know, a lot of their bowel has been removed so they can\\'t include the regular way, uh, or people who have cancer and the cancer is blocking her bowels and we have to figure out ways to is to give them so they can survive, you know, as they\\'re finishing chemotherapy. So a really sick population of patients. Uh, but then at fellowship wasn\\'t teaching me about, you know, how to feed people who have diabetes. It wasn\\'t talking about like everyday stuff. Uh, so that\\'s, that\\'s why I went to culinary arts school and in the evening and got trained as a chef and a, culinary arts training. Uh, you had to actually take a nutrition class. And the crazy thing is, you know, throughout medical school, I didn\\'t have a nutrition class. I had to go to culinary arts school to get my first class and nutrition. Wow. And I went to a top notch medical school. I mean like one of the best in the country.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1375.15\">22:55</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that\\'s crazy. But that, that\\'s like the state of healthcare nowadays. And that also explains why, you know, we spend all this money on healthcare. We\\'re the number one in the world when it comes to health spending. But in terms of, you know, our actual longevity, I think the United States where it\\'s like 31st 33 in the world as far as how long were you actually living was there\\'s a huge disconnect. Like we spend all this money but we don\\'t necessarily get the outcome that we\\'re paying for. So a lot of it has to do with we\\'re, we\\'re missing the simple stuff. And the simple stuff is important. So yes, you know, you can get the craziest complex surgery here. Uh, you can come see me for colonoscopies and I can take out polyps and possibly move cancers and you know, all these problems. But when it comes to, you know, the foundation for preventing some of these problems, uh, I think there\\'s a lot of room for improvement in that space and you know, doctors play a role, uh, but there\\'s a lot of stuff that can be done outside of the hospital and you know, the kitchen is just as important.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1442.7\">24:02</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the kitchen is probably as important as the medicine cabinet.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1447.52\">24:07</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, I just thank you so much for sharing that by the way. Ours is my, my second time, maybe third time hearing that story and it just gets better every time I hear it. He was like, I just get some nuggets out of it. So thank you so much for sharing that Dr Mcdonald and I think I echo exactly what you\\'re setting and uh, and what this entire, you know, what does the entire concept of unconventional one of us is really centered around is still the patient provider relationship. There\\'s still massive value in that. And I think that we both can say that we appreciate the fact that we live in a society where we do have major advancements in medical care. I mean, people are getting cured from different types of cancers all the time, all around the world. I mean, we might be on the cost of actually understanding.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1496.93\">24:56</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, we now live in a world where we can treat hepatitis C, where we never. We never thought about that when I was going through PA school or medical school. Yeah. That was it. We were talking about, you know, these folks possibly having to go on the liver transplant list, but now we have a medication that could do it. So amen to the, to the advancements that we have in our medical care. But yes, some of those statistics that came out of the same conference that we attended was a, you know, it\\'s unbelievable how 80 percent of Americans have a preventable disease. We don\\'t die from tuberculosis anymore in this country, you know? Yeah. We\\'ll get cases of it and stuff like that. But other, by and far these things have been treated and we thankfully have a society free of them. Um, but of that 80 percent of American, um, you know, depending upon, I guess the, the source that you\\'re looking at.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1549.19\">25:49</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\\'ve seen it as high as $2,000,000,000,000 in American medical costs to actually manage those 80 percent of Americans who have a preventable disease and so there\\'s got to be. There\\'s a problem here and I think that the biggest disconnect starts with the choices that we as the patients are actually making and so we need to empower our physicians, I think to let them understand that we want this and we need this and that. I don\\'t care to be seen by a doctor, you know, many times throughout my entire year, I would love to come in, shake a hand, maybe have to do my colonoscopy when I\\'m 50 and you know, everything looks good. Mr Ritz, take care. Of, you know, I would love to. We would love for it to be like that, but you\\'re absolutely right. I think that we are really losing touch with food. It\\'s becoming far too easy for us to look at a way\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1604.88\">26:44</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying, I just need this food. Maybe it is fast. We have a very fast food mentality and I\\'m not talking about just fast as restaurants. I think I\\'m talking about. We have this mentality that whole foods has made a massive market for themselves and they\\'re a multibillion dollar corporation on the sense that yes, they sell good food, but the thing is, is that they also, you know, the reason why they were able to get people into the door was that they were taking their good food and then we\\'re making it fast. So you could walk up and say, I want this, I want this, I want this. They\\'ll put it into a tray and then you\\'re out the door. So at least we\\'re eating healthy foods. But yes, it\\'s still a fast food mentality. So let me think about whole foods. We act like wholesome is a brand new concept, but if you go back to the 19 seventies, you know, 50, 60 years, etc.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1652.16\">27:32</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every grocery store will hold on it. It, you know, there wasn\\'t a whoLe, like most of the vegetables organic. Uh, if you went to the deli section, do you had, you know, people who really worked at a deli section mate fluid in the deli section. Um, so if anything, wholefoods is just returning to, you know, simpler day what we just focused on absolute. Well. And then one of the other talks that I remember that you had during your discussion with us at the conference was a, you know, these food swamps, food deserts, you know, and so if you wouldn\\'t mind, could you describe a little bit about the food swamps in food desert concept for whiskers? Yeah. So, you know, food deserts, it\\'s a term that really became popular and then they 2000 and it really describes neighborhoods where there is a lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, grocery stories that contain, you know, fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1708.14\">28:28</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these neIghborhoods have convenience stores but not necessarily full fledged grocery stores. Uh, so those are basically call it food deserts. And the term actually originated in scotland and originate and United States. United states kind of took it and ran with it. Um, so chicago, a city in which I live in a definitely have some food deserts and most of the food desert is actually, uh, an african american neighborhood. It\\'s not all of them are african american neighborhood. Okay. Uh, so food deserts do not affect everyone equally. However, allow retail areas, which they don\\'t really get as much attention as he deserved. A, are also qualified as food deserts for different reasons. And so even though real areas may have farms and stuff like that, but, um, the fruit growing on those farms may not actually get to the residents of those areas and many places.\\n\\nDr. McDonald:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1762.14\">29:22</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those area technically can, are considered food deserts, a food swamps, a little bit different concept. If anything, it\\'s more of a realistic concept because one, if you go to any urban community has designated a food desert. It\\'s not like you won\\'t see food. Uh, there\\'s plenty of food joints and you know, a plenty convenience stores. Uh, and so in many ways, those areas or swamp a swamp, unhealthy food and the food swamps, if anything, that\\'s really driving a problem. Uh, you know, imagine if you\\'re, if you don\\'t have a whole lot of money, a hit, you\\'re hungry. And when you\\'re driving home from work or walking home from work or taking the train from home from work or just, you know, walking around the neighborhood in general and you pass, you know, your favorite barbecue spot or your favorite chicken joint or you know, mcdonald\\'s or whatever, and you have to walk by all of these places. Uh, and these are places are the list of foods. It\\'s not like the food taste better places and it\\'s so easy and so tempting just to walk in there and get, you know, three wings for $2 or interference for us. And it\\'s hard to, to be healthy in that scenario. I mean, it takes, like I, I hate to say everyone wants to talk aboUt willpower and self control and like I feel like these concepts are unfair to some degree because it\\'s hard out here.\\n\\nFrank:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.temi.com/editor/t/-011CSLg-y5Va19dD-5mTcRj1j1haUOZNNY9oIP2h748PPrKKNVslNzvytQO_fzfEN3s6gXNl9jHPh56JITyKDUeH5k?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1858.09\">30:58</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that\\'s all the time that we have for today\\'s podcast.
